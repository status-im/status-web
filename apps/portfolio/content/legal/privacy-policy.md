This Status Website - Privacy Policy is intended to inform users of Status' approach to privacy in respect of its website (**"Website"**). In this regard, if you are visiting our Website, this Status Website - Privacy Policy applies to you. This Status Website - Privacy Policy does not apply to you if you are visiting any other Status website. In such cases please consult the relevant privacy policy as applicable.

## 1. Who we are

Whenever "Status" or "we" is used in this Status Website - Privacy Policy, we're referring to Status Research & Development GmbH, a Swiss company with its registered offices at Baarerstrasse 10, 6302 Zug Switzerland. Our contact information can be found on our website and at the end of this Status Website - Privacy Policy.

## 2. Status limits its collection and processing of personal data from your use of the Website

Status limits its collection and processing of personal data from users of the Website. As such, we only collect and process the following personal data:

- **Registration information:** Status collects information from you when you register on the Website for various reasons, such as to sign-up to early access or to participate in discussion features of the Website. When registering on our site, you may be asked to enter your name, your e-mail address, a username or an Ethereum address. You may, however, visit our site without registering. Your e-mail address will be verified by an email containing a unique link. If that link is visited, we know that you control the e-mail address.
- **IP address:** We note that Status itself does not collect IP addresses of users, however this may still be collected by third parties, namely the hosting provider of this Website. For more on this, please see the section below: "Third party collection of personal data".
  Analytics: Status also makes use of privacy focused analytics which collects trends and insights (but not personal details) about website visitors. As part of such use, we briefly process your IP address but we have no way of identifying you. We however have a legitimate interest in processing such IP addresses to improve our website and business continually. This IP address is not stored over time.

## 3. Third party collection of personal data

In addition to the above, Status utilises a third party provider (**"Hosting Provider"**) who hosts this Website and may automatically collect, process and store certain personal data that includes IP addresses, system configuration information, and other information about traffic to and from the Website, as well as (general) location information derived from such IP addresses. The personal information and the purpose for which it is collected by the hosting provider of this Website is set out in their privacy policy (with you, being referred to as the "End User"). We do note however the following:

- **IP addresses:** As part of the Hosting Provider' provision of hosting services to Status, they may also indirectly collect and process your IP address. They further utilise a third-party database to map the general location to which each IP address corresponds (**"Location Information"**). The Location Information that is mapped from an IP address is limited to country and city, however the precise location is not identifiable. The Hosting Provider uses this Location Information in order to more effectively provide their services to Status.
- **Cookies:** While Status itself does not use cookies on the Website, the Hosting Provider may further set cookies on the Website which are necessary for purposes such as its functionality and use.

## 4. Security measures we take in respect of the website

As a general approach, Status takes data security seriously and the measures we take as an organisation. In respect of the Website, we implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal data when you enter, submit, or access such information.

## 5. Exporting data outside the European Union and Switzerland

While it is not intended that Status will export your personal data from the website outside the European Union, Status (and the Hosting Provider) is obliged to protect the privacy of such personal data if it is exported outside the European Union or Switzerland and it will only be processed in countries or by parties that provide an adequate level of protection as deemed by Switzerland or the European Commission. Otherwise, Status will use specific forms of contractual clauses to ensure such personal data is provided the same protection as required in Switzerland or Europe. The transmission of personal data outside the European Union and Switzerland will always occur in conformity with applicable privacy legislation.

## 6. Your choices and rights

Ask us for a copy of your personal data, which may also be transferred to another data controller at your request;

Object to the processing of your personal data; and
File a complaint with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), if you believe that your personal data has been processed unlawfully.
