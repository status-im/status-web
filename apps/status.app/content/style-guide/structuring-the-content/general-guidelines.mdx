title: Structuring the content
---

- Keep it short. Articles between 300-400 words are easy to read and support the user's workflow. Shorter articles are OK, but articles beyond 600 words are not. If necessary, organize the information into different articles.
- Each paragraph has a single purpose and describes a single concept. Avoid mixing concepts in the same paragraph or repeating the same information in different paragraphs.
- Use [admonitions](../formatting.mdx) selectively and strategically. Documents with multiple admonitions are harder to read. Add the information as a regular sentence or paragraph if you use more than three admonitions in a single document.
- When there is more than one way to do something or describe something, use the most straightforward way only. Don't discuss all the possible ways.

<Admonition type="tip">
    If it's worth mentioning an alternative method of completing a procedure, use a tip-style admonition to briefly describe the alternative way.
