When creating technical content for Status, consider these guidelines:

- Write in a friendly, casual, and human tone without sounding bossy, informal, or funny.
- Write declarative and straightforward prose with short sentences and paragraphs, and use everyday vocabulary. Don't make things any more complicated than they are. Write as you speak.
- Make every word matter. Avoid words or constructions that make a text harder to read or obfuscate information or the meaning of a sentence. Be precise.
- Use *you* or *your* to address the user. The user and user's goals are at the center of the action, not the software.
- Don't use cultural or local expressions, made-up words, figurative language, obscure acronyms, metaphors, or (needless to say) discriminatory language. Write for a general audience without considering factors such as race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, or gender.
- Don't assume the reader has prior knowledge of a new concept when introducing it. Instead, explain the idea in simple terms and provide readers with resources or related topics to find out more.
- Use a positive tone. Technical documentation should present information in a positive and helpful manner. Instead of describing what a product or feature can't do, focus on what it can do. This will help users understand the capabilities and benefits of the product or feature.
- We don't obsess over grammar rules. Language isn't an exact science, and different style guides use different conventions. This guide follows the rule commonly accepted, disregarding exceptions.
- Status documentation should be written in Global English using Oxford spelling.
