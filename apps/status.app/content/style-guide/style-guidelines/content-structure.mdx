title: Content structure 
---

How we structure and present the information is just as critical as writing it. Users don't read documentation; they scan it. Our approach to content structure supports them in this workflow rather than getting in the way.

Many style guides spend considerable time explaining language style and grammar rules. Still, they rarely provide guidelines to create easy-to-read and follow documents consistently. Because of this, this style guide offers detailed instructions for structuring your content.

We employ a progressive-disclosure approach, providing only the necessary information at the first level (usually, a task or a concept description) while allowing users to explore additional details at subsequent levels (subtasks, cross-links, table of contents, and so forth).

We use a topic-based approach based on DITA and well-established information design patterns, where each type of article adheres to a specific structure. However, we don't follow (nor want to follow) a strict DITA approach to documentation.
