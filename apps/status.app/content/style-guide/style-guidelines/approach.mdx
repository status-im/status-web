User experience is at the heart of what we write. We write documentation to help users achieve their goals, overcome roadblocks, and encourage them to explore the Status app. In addition, we provide ways for readers to submit feedback , and we constantly improve our documents based on this feedback.

When deciding what to write, we're user-oriented. And when designing documents, we're task-oriented, explaining the main tasks a user can complete on a particular screen or product feature.

We describe the user's tasks on the interface; we don't explain the user interface. We work with the Design and UX team to provide users with a modern and consistent experience in our app and documentation.

We use the topic and article words indistinctly on this guide. Even though the definition of a topic in technical communication varies based on the methodology or author, this distinction is irrelevant here.
