title: Admonitions
---

- Status user documentation uses three different types of admonitions (also known as *callouts*):

<Table>
  <TableHead>
    <TableHeader>Admonition</TableHeader>
    <TableHeader>Description</TableHeader>
  </TableHead>

  <TableContent>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Tip</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Information that is not necessary for the task, but it's helpful or nice to have. For example, information about a keyboard shortcut.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Note</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Information that is relevant to complete the task, but has no impact on the user's actions.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Caution</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Information that has an impact on the user's actions. Based on this information, the user may decide to complete or don't complete the task.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableContent>
</Table>

- Don't use *warning*, *error*, *danger*, *bug*, *important*, or *notes*.
- Don't use admonitions within procedural steps.
- In procedures, place the admonition after the procedure (see Structuring the content for more details.)
- For other content, add the admonition after the relevant information.
