title: Bullet lists
---

- Don't use a bullet list for actions that users should complete in an orderly manner; use numbered lists in procedures.
- Use a bullet list to improve the readability of sentences or paragraphs where you list or describe three or more items.

<Table>
  <TableHead>
    <TableHeader>Usage</TableHeader>
    <TableHeader>Example</TableHeader>
  </TableHead>

  <TableContent>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>**Correct**</TableCell>
      <TableCell>You can find four different types of contacts in your contact list:<br />- Trusted<br />- Verified<br />- Pending verification<br />- Blocked.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Incorrect</TableCell>
      <TableCell>You can find four different types of contacts in your contact lists: trusted, verified, pending verification, and blocked.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Incorrect</TableCell>
      <TableCell>You can find trusted, verified, pending verification, and blocked contacts on your contact list.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableContent>
</Table>

- Use a colon (:) before the bullet list items.
- Use periods at the end of each sentence in a bullet list for [punctuation](#punctuation). Using periods on a bullet list can be tricky. Use the following guidelines:
    - When the list items are complete sentences, use a period at the end of each sentence.
    - Don't use a period when the list items are not complete sentences or sentences with three words or less.
    - In a list with elements of more and less than three words mixed, don't use a period.
- Don't use colons after each item on [a list](#bullet-lists); type the item definition on a new line. Here are some examples of using punctuation on a list:

<Table>
  <TableHead>
    <TableHeader>Usage</TableHeader>
    <TableHeader>Example</TableHeader>
  </TableHead>
  <TableContent>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>**Correct**</TableCell>
      <TableCell>- **Blue badge**<br />The user is a verified contact and you completed mutual authentication successfully.<br />- **Red badge**<br />The user is not a verified contact.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Incorrect</TableCell>
      <TableCell>- **Blue badge**:<br />The user is a verified contact and you completed mutual authentication successfully.<br />- **Red badge**:<br />The user is not a verified contact.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Incorrect</TableCell>
      <TableCell>- **Blue badge**: The user is a verified contact and you completed mutual authentication successfully.<br />- **Red badge**: The user is not a verified contact.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableContent>
</Table>

  When you need to describe each element on a list and you have more than three elements, consider using a table instead.
