- Don't use idioms, colloquial expressions, and culture-specific references. When writing examples to clarify a feature or concept, don't use historical references, brand names, social or political events, or any other topic that might be controversial or meaningless for a global audience.
- Observe the [style rules for numbers, date and time, and units of measure](#numbers-date-and-time-currencies-and-units-of-measure).
- Avoid using *they* to refer to the neutral gender. While this is a perfectly valid rule in English, it may be challenging to interpret by non-native English speakers.
- Use left and right carefully. Localized products in left-to-right (LTR) languages may have labels on the opposite side. Refer the reader to the specific UI element on the screen instead.
- Don't use pronouns like *Who*, *Whose*, or *Its*; replace the pronoun with the noun.
- Avoid using *(s)* for plural forms.
