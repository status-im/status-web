title: Contractions
---

- Use contractions to make your text more casual.

<Table>
  <TableHead>
    <TableHeader>Usage</TableHeader>
    <TableHeader>Example</TableHeader>
  </TableHead>
  <TableContent>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>**Use**</TableCell>
      <TableCell>you're / isn't / can't / it's </TableCell>
    </TableRow>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Avoid</TableCell>
      <TableCell>you are / is not / cannot / it is</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableContent>
</Table>

- Avoid the *'d* (had or would) and *'ve* (have) contractions, as these may be difficult to understand for non-native speakers.
