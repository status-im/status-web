- Avoid. Unnecessary. Punctuation.
- Use these guidelines for commas:
    - Use commas to separate main clauses.
    - Use a comma before *such as*.
    - Use a comma after *for example*.
    - Use the Oxford comma for *and* and *or* conjunctions where the meaning of your sentence would otherwise be unclear. In other cases, avoid placing the extra comma.
    - In procedural steps, don't write a comma in sentences such as *click on cancel, and then...*
- Use these guidelines for periods:
    - Use a period at the end of a sentence, including sentences ending on a [URL](./links.mdx).
    - Observe the punctuation rules for items on a [bullet list](./bullet-lists.mdx).
    - Observe the punctuation rules for items on a [table](./tables.mdx).
- Don't use semicolons. Instead, use a period and write the text after the semicolon in a new sentence.
- Avoid preceding tables with colons. Instead, use a period.
- Don't use dashes (_em_ or _en_ dashes.) Instead, use parenthesis if you need to clarify information.
- Use parenthesis sparingly, and don't write essential information inside parenthesis.
- Don't use bold or italics with punctuation symbols.
- When you must use quotes, use double straight quotes. Don't use quotes with user interface elements.
- Observe the [bullet lists](./bullet-lists.mdx) punctuation rules.
