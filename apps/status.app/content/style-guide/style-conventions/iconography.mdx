The Status documentation uses the application icons to guide readers' actions on the app.

- Use icons in procedural steps to guide the user's actions.
- Don't overuse icons. A document with many icons is harder to follow and scan.
- Write the icon first, and then the icon's name in bold typeface. If the icon shows a label in the UI, use the UI label.
- Use the Status icon codes found in this [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/iGkQMX8JCkHe0yLu2nA95w/Icons-%2F-Docs-team?type=design&node-id=0%3A1678&mode=design&t=7qslrYf7F6YSHsa0-1).
