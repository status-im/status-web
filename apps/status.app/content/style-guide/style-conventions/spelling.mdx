Use the Oxford spelling.

- Use the suffix *-ize* instead of *-ise*. As such, write *organize* and *organization*, not *organise* and *organisation*.
- The rule above doesn't affect the spelling of words ending in *-yse*, such as *analyse*.
- Some examples of the Oxford spelling include: globalization, behaviour, centre, defence, catalogue, programme.
- If in doubt about any spelling, please refer to the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/).
