<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can unlock your Keycard with the PUK on Status desktop only, and with the recovery phrase on both mobile and desktop apps. For more information, see [Keycard functionality by platform](./keycard-functionality-by-platform.mdx).
</Admonition>

To prevent unauthorized access, your Keycard locks itself after entering a wrong PIN three times. To keep using your Keycard, you must unlock it.

## What to expect

- Once unlocked, your Keycard is ready for use, just like before it was locked.
- To unlock the Keycard, you can use the [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx) of the profile or Wallet accounts on your Keycard, or the [Keycard PUK](./create-a-keycard-puk.mdx).
- If you don't remember your recovery phrase or Keycard PUK, read [If you can't unlock your Keycard](./if-you-can-t-unlock-your-keycard.mdx).
- You can use any device running Status to unlock a Keycard. You don't have to use the device running the Status profile that the Keycard is linked to.
