<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only disconnect your Keycard with your Status profile or Wallet accounts using the Status desktop app.
</Admonition>

To stop using Keycard for a Wallet account or Status profile, you copy your [private key](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx#about-your-status-keys) from the Keycard to your device. After that, you use your password or biometrics to perform security-sensitive actions such as signing in to your profile or signing a transaction. The Keycard is disconnected from your profile and is no longer shown in <ContextTag icon={<SettingsDesktopIcon />}>Settings</ContextTag> > <ContextTag icon={<KeycardDesktopIcon />}>Keycard</ContextTag>.

## What to expect

- Disconnecting your Keycard only affects how you authenticate when using your Wallet account or profile.
- When you copy the private key of a Wallet account to your device, the Status app links the Wallet account with the Status profile you are using. You then access and use the Wallet account with the profile's password or biometrics.
- When you copy the private key of a Status profile to your device, see [If your Keycard holds your profile](#if-your-keycard-holds-your-profile).
- You can keep the Keycard as a backup or [factory reset this Keycard](./factory-reset-your-keycard.mdx) and use it for another Wallet account or Status profile.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Status doesn't know your password and cannot reset it for you. If you forget your password and don't have your recovery phrase, you lose access to your Status profile and Wallet accounts. Always keep your password safe.
</Admonition>

## If your Keycard holds your profile

To copy your profile private key, you must enter your [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx#about-your-recovery-phrase). Next, the Status app prompts you to create a password and optionally enable biometrics for future access. If you use the profile across multiple devices, you need to repeat this process on each device.

If your devices are not [in sync](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx), you still need to use your Keycard to sign in to the profile before you can set up a password. To simplify your login process, [use the same password for the same profile on all devices](../profile/about-changing-your-status-password.mdx).
