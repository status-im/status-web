A [Keycard](https://keycard.tech/keycard)<ExternalIcon /> is a physical device that stores the [private key](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx#about-your-status-keys) of your Status profile or Wallet account separately from your device, protecting your private key from potential threats.

## Use Keycard with your mobile phone

Mobile devices recognize your Keycard using NFC. The NFC module varies depending on the brand and model of your phone.

For example, on iPhones, the NFC module is at the top of the device, while on flip phones, it's near the bottom of the back.

On Android devices, the NFC module is on the back of the phone, usually in the middle or near the camera area.

On some models, you need to manually enable NFC, while others automatically activate it when you hold your Keycard nearby.

## Use Keycard with your computer

Computers recognize your Keycard using a smart card reader. You can use any card reader compatible with your computer's operating system.

When you purchase a Keycard, you receive a card reader with a USB-C connector. If your computer does not have a USB-C port, you can use an adapter or a smart card reader with the correct connector for your computer.

## Connect your Keycard to your device

When the Status app requires your Keycard, it prompts you to connect it to your device. For example, when you want to sign a transaction or access your profile.
