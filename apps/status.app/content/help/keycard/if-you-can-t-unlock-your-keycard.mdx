title: If you can't unlock your Keycard

Your Keycard locks itself after entering a wrong PIN three times. To keep using your Keycard, you must [unlock it](./unlock-your-keycard.mdx) with your Keycard PUK or recovery phrase.

If you don't remember the recovery phrase of the profile or Wallet accounts on your Keycard, and you didn't set a Keycard PUK or you lose the PUK, you can't unlock your Keycard.

<Admonition type="tip">
  If your Keycard is not locked, but you lose the recovery phrase, you can still access your Status profile or Wallet accounts. However, to protect your funds and profile data, you should [create a new Status profile](../getting-started/run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time.mdx). For more information, check out [If you lose your recovery phrase](../profile/if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx#if-you-lost-your-recovery-phrase-but-know-your-status-password).

## What to do if you can't unlock your Keycard

If you can't unlock your Keycard, you have two options:

**1. Check if you are signed in to your Status profile with biometrics enabled on Status Desktop.**

- **Yes**: You may still be able to save your wallet funds by [sending them to a different address](../wallet/send-crypto-to-someone.mdx) using your [biometrics on Status desktop](../profile/enable-biometrics-for-your-status-profile.mdx).

- **No**: You can't unlock your Keycard or access your funds. Your data and wallet funds are lost permanently. To understand why, read [What happens if you can't unlock your Keycard](#what-happens-if-you-cant-unlock-your-keycard).

**2. Repurpose your Keycard.**

- You can reuse the Keycard to set up a new profile or Wallet account after a [factory reset](./factory-reset-your-keycard.mdx).

  The factory reset erases all data, including the private key of the current profile or Wallet accounts on the Keycard.

## What happens if you can't unlock your Keycard

Unfortunately, you lose access to your Status data and wallet funds forever.

When you set up your Keycard, your Status profile keys and wallet accounts move from the app to the Keycard. These keys are the private cryptographic codes that give you control over your profile and wallet. After that, you can only access your profile and wallet using your Keycard or recovery phrase.
