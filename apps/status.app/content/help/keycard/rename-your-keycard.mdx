<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only rename your Keycard on the Status desktop app.
</Admonition>

You can name your Keycard to track which account it holds, and you have the option to rename it if needed.

If someone finds your lost Keycard, they can't see its name or the account name without knowing your Keycard [PIN or PUK](./about-your-keycard-pin-and-puk.mdx).
