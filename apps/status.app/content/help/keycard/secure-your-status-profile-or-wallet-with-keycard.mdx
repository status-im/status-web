<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only use your Keycard with your Status profile and the Wallet accounts associated the same recovery phrase on the Status mobile app. You can use your Keycard to protect your profile, your profile associated Wallet accounts and [imported wallet accounts](../wallet/import-an-account-into-your-status-wallet.mdx) on the Status desktop app.
</Admonition>

You can enhance the security of your Status profile and Wallet using the [Keycard hardware wallet](https://status.app/keycard)<ExternalIcon />. To do so, you transfer them from the Status app to the Keycard by entering the [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx#about-your-recovery-phrase).

A Keycard is a physical equipment that stores your private keys separately from your device, helping protect your funds even if your device is compromised. To make transactions in Status, you must physically connect your Keycard to your computer using a card reader or scan the Keycard on your phone's NFC component.

If your Status profile has multiple [key pairs](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx#about-your-status-keys), you can link only one to one Keycard. After setting up the Keycard, you can [view the wallet accounts on your Keycard](./view-the-profile-or-wallet-accounts-on-your-keycard.mdx) and confirm which key pair you link.

<Admonition type="info">
  In the Status Wallet, a single [master key pair](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx#status-chat-key-and-wallet-account-address) can generate multiple wallet accounts, each with a unique key pair and address.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you already have a crypto wallet account and you want to use it in Status Wallet and protect it with Keycard, check out [Import a wallet account onto Keycard and use it in Status](./import-a-wallet-account-from-another-app-onto-keycard-and-use-it-in-status.mdx).
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- If you use your Keycard with the Status desktop app, you need a [card reader](./keycard-faq.mdx) to connect a Keycard to your computer.
- Your Keycard must be empty. If it's not new, [view the wallet accounts on your Keycard](./view-the-profile-or-wallet-accounts-on-your-keycard.mdx) and [factory reset](./factory-reset-your-keycard.mdx) it when needed.
- If you use the Keycard with your profile, the Keycard also protects all Wallet accounts that use the same recovery phrase.
- You must use the Keycard to confirm your identity and approve transactions for the protected profile or Wallet accounts.
