<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

Your Status password protects both your Status profile and associated Wallet accounts. Scenarios such as switching to another profile or signing transactions require your password.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Status doesn't know your password and cannot reset it for you. If you forget your password and don't have your recovery phrase, you lose access to your Status profile and Wallet accounts and wallet funds. If you lose your password, check out [If you lose your Status password or recovery phrase](./if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx) for more information.

You can change your password at any time. However, unlike centralized services that store your password centrally, Status operates on a [peer-to-peer network](../messaging/about-status-messages.mdx#understand-peer-to-peer-messaging) and doesn't transfer your password through this network. Your password stays local to the device where you set it.

This means that if you change your password on one device, you need to manually update it on all devices where you use the same Status profile. If not, you must use the previous password to access your Status profile on those devices.

<Admonition type="info">
  When you set up syncing, the Status app transfers your password to the new device using the QR code or sync code, so you can use the password on your new device.

This table outlines how your actions involving your password affect its use.

    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Change your password on one device for one profile</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The new password only works for this specific profile on the device where you change it. To simplify your login process, update your password for this profile on other devices in sync.</TableCell>
