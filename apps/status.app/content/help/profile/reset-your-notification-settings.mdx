If you set custom notification settings before, but you don't receive the notifications you expect any more, you can reset your settings. Doing so removes any exceptions, and the notification settings return to their default values.

## Reset your notification settings

You can reset your notification settings for communities, channels, group chats and direct messages (DM). Here's how:

<Tabs defaultValue="Mobile">
  <TabsList size={32}>
    <TabsTrigger value="Mobile">
      Mobile
    </TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>

  <TabsContent value="Mobile">
    1. From the tab bar, tap <ContextTag icon={<CommunitiesIcon />}>Communities</ContextTag> to reset your notifications settings in a community or channel, or tap <ContextTag icon={<MessengerIcon />}>Messages</ContextTag> to reset your notifications settings in a group chat or DM chat.
    1. Tap the community, channel, group chat or DM chat where you want to reset the notifications settings.
    1. In the top navigation, tap <ContextTag icon={<OptionsIcon />}>More options</ContextTag>.
    1. Tap <ContextTag icon={<NotificationsIcon />}>Notification settings</ContextTag>.
    1. Tap <ContextTag>Reset to default notifications settings</ContextTag>.
    1. Tap <ContextTag>Change settings</ContextTag>.
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>
