<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

When you decide not to use Status on the current device, you can log out to keep your profile secure. Status logs you out automatically after some app updates or when you uninstall the app.

<Admonition type="caution">
  If you log out without [backing up the recovery phrase](./back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx) and saving your password, you can't access your Status profile or the associated data and funds again. Keep the password and the recovery phrase in a safe place. Status can't recover or reset them for you.
