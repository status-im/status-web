<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

When you lose access to your Status password or recovery phrase, you may lose access to your Status data and wallet funds. Status can't recover your data or wallet funds for you due to its [decentralized architecture](../getting-started/what-is-status.mdx). It's your responsibility to keep your password and recovery phrase safe.

<Admonition type="info">
  If you have your recovery phrase, your wallet funds are safe. In this case, [restore your Status profile](../getting-started/create-a-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase.mdx) using your recovery phrase.
</Admonition>

Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to recover your Status data and wallet funds. Choose the option that describes your situation:

- [You have your recovery phrase but lost your Status password](#if-you-have-your-recovery-phrase-but-lost-your-status-password).
- [You lost your recovery phrase but know your Status password](#if-you-lost-your-recovery-phrase-but-know-your-status-password).
- [You lost your recovery phrase and Status password](#if-you-lost-your-recovery-phrase-and-status-password).

## If you have your recovery phrase but lost your Status password

Use your recovery phrase to access your wallet funds if you can't sign in due to a lost password, [Keycard](../keycard/keycard-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) or biometrics setup. Read [Create a Status profile using a recovery phrase](../getting-started/create-a-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase.mdx) for instructions.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Status doesn't know your password and can't reset it for you. If you forget your password and don't have your recovery phrase, you lose access to your Status profile and Wallet accounts.
</Admonition>

## If you lost your recovery phrase but know your Status password

If you lost your recovery phrase but can still sign in to your Status profile (using your password, [Keycard](../keycard/keycard-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) or biometrics), you can still access your profile and wallet funds.

However, continuing to use this profile can pose risks and you should [create a new one](../getting-started/run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time.mdx). For example, if your current device stops working, you can't [log in with this profile on a new device](./sign-in-to-your-status-profile-on-a-new-device.mdx).

You can save the wallet funds by sending them to a different wallet account. Follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the Status profile where you lost your recovery phrase.
1. Verify if your recovery phrase is still [available in the Status app](./back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx#back-up-your-recovery-phrase). If it's available, [back up your recovery phrase](./back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx#back-up-your-recovery-phrase). Your wallet funds are safe and you don't need to do anything else. If your recovery phrase isn't available, continue with the next step.
1. [Log out of Status](./log-out-of-status.mdx) and [create a new Status profile](../getting-started/run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time.mdx). This creates a new key pair and wallet account.
1. Sign in to your new Status profile and copy the account address in your new Status Wallet.
1. [Log out](./log-out-of-status.mdx) of your new profile and sign in to the profile where you lost your recovery phrase.
1. From the Status profile where you lost your recovery phrase, [send all your wallet funds](../wallet/send-crypto-to-someone.mdx) to the new address.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Status can't see your recovery phrase or recover it for you. [Keep your recovery phrase safe](./back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx), and never share this information with anyone.
</Admonition>

## If you lost your recovery phrase and Status password

If you lost your recovery phrase and can't sign in to your Status profile due to a lost password, [Keycard](../keycard/keycard-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) or biometrics setup, you lose access to your Status data and wallet funds forever.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Status can't see or access your password or recovery phrase. If you lose them or forget them, Status can't recover or reset them.
</Admonition>

In this situation, if you're still signed in to your Status profile, you may be able to save the wallet funds by sending them to a different address.

Follow these steps:

1. Don't log out of Status and don't change to another app. Plug in your device to charge it. Don't restart your device or update the Status app.
1. Verify if your recovery phrase is still [available in the Status app](./back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx#back-up-your-recovery-phrase). If available, [back up your recovery phrase](./back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx#back-up-your-recovery-phrase). Your wallet funds are safe, but you need to [create a new Status profile with the recovery phrase](../getting-started/create-a-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase.mdx) because your password is lost. If your recovery phrase is not available, continue with the next step.
1. Using a second device, [create a new Status profile](../getting-started/run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time.mdx). This creates a new key pair and wallet account.
1. On the second device, copy the account address in your new Status Wallet.
1. From the Status profile where you lost your recovery phrase and password, [send all your wallet funds](../wallet/send-crypto-to-someone.mdx) to the new address.
