You can customize the messages and mentions notifications you receive in communities and channels. By doing so, you only receive the notifications relevant to you.

The notifications you customize for a community apply to all its channels. For example, suppose you decide to [mute all community notifications](#mute-community-notifications). In that case, you won't receive any notification from any channel, even if someone mentions you. To customize notifications for specific channels, check out Set up and customize notification exceptions.

This article describes common examples.

## Mute community notifications

You can turn off your notifications for specific communities for a designated period. When you mute all notifications for a community, a <ContextTag icon={<NotificationMuteDesktopIcon />}>Mute</ContextTag> symbol appears next to the community name.

  </TabsList>

## Mute community notifications except global mentions

If you want to avoid missing general announcements, you can selectively mute some notifications, except global mentions (such as <ContextTag>@everyone</ContextTag>). This example explains how to turn off all notifications for a specific community while maintaining global mentions. This can be helpful in very active communities where you're only interested in global mentions, such as <ContextTag>@everyone</ContextTag>.

## Set the same notification setting for all messages in a community
