<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

Status users who search for your profile or you interact with can send you contact requests. For example, users you have shared your profile with or those in mutual communities or group chats with you.

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you want to send a contact request, check out [Add a contact in Status](../messaging/add-a-contact-in-status.mdx).
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- Contact requests expire after seven days.
- Status users can send you a new request every seven days. If it bothers you, consider [blocking the user](../profile/block-or-unblock-someone-in-status.mdx#block-a-stranger).
- People you have [blocked](./block-or-unblock-someone-in-status.mdx) can't see your profile or send you a contact request.
- Rejecting a request does not notify the sender.
- You can [turn off contact requests](./respond-to-a-contact-request.mdx#stop-receiving-contact-requests).

  In Status, you can [label other users' profiles](./understand-status-profile-labels.mdx). For example, whether you accept or reject the contact request from someone, you can [block the user](./block-or-unblock-someone-in-status.mdx) or [mark the user as untrusted](./verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx). After you accept the request, you can [verify the user's identity](./verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx) or
  [mark the user as identity verified](./verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx).
