If you are sure you are entering the correct password, but it doesn't work, here are the possible reasons and solutions:

<Table>
  <TableHead>
    <TableHeader>Reason</TableHeader>
    <TableHeader>Solution</TableHeader>
    <TableHeader>Notes</TableHeader>
  </TableHead>

  <TableContent>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Password updates</TableCell>
      <TableCell>If you have [changed the password](./change-your-status-password.mdx) on one device, you must sign in with the old password on other devices and manually update the password.</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The Status app doesn't automatically sync your password across the devices where you use Status.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>

    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Password for a different device</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Enter the password you set for this profile on this particular device.</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The Status password is device-specific.<br />If you set different passwords for a specific Status profile on multiple devices, the passwords don't synchronize and work independently.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>

    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Password for a different profile</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Enter the password you set for this profile on this particular device.</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The Status password is profile-specific. <br /> If you have multiple profiles on one device, you can set different passwords for them.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>

    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Caps lock</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Turn off the <ContextTag>Caps lock</ContextTag> key on your keyboard.</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Status passwords are case-sensitive.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>

    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>Keyboard layout</TableCell>
      <TableCell>Set your keyboard to the correct language input for your password.</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The keyboard layout can affect the letters and symbols you type.</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableContent>
</Table>

Double-check the <ContextTag>Caps lock</ContextTag> being on or an unexpected change in your keyboard layout. You can also try typing your password into a text editor first to confirm that the characters are exactly as intended.
