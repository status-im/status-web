<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only customize membership request notifications in the Status mobile app.
</Admonition>

If [manual request approval](../communities/set-up-your-community-join-requests.mdx) is required to join your community, you receive a notification every time someone requests to join.

There are three notification options you can choose from: <ContextTag>Notification on</ContextTag>, <ContextTag>In notification centre only</ContextTag> and <ContextTag>Notifications off</ContextTag>. For each one of them, follow the same procedure and use the table below as a reference.

<Admonition type="info">
  Since there's currently no way to customize notifications in the Status Desktop app, you can [mute all notification](../profile/mute-your-notifications.mdx) if you are receiving too many notification requests.
</Admonition>
