<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

If you use Status on more than one device, sync your profile so it's up to date on every device, and you can switch between them seamlessly. Without syncing, you are likely to set up the same options more than once and receive multiple notifications for one single message.

<Admonition type="tip">
  You can use this procedure to [sign in to your profile on a new device](./sign-in-to-your-status-profile-on-a-new-device.mdx).
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Make sure your Status mobile app version is 2.0 or higher. The legacy Status mobile app (version 1.2 and below) doesn't support syncing profiles.
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- You can pair and sync up to three devices, including mobile devices and computers. You can sync a mobile device or computer with another device or computer.
- Once you set up the syncing, your Status profile data on your devices are in sync automatically until you unpair the devices.
- Your profile data includes your message status (read or unread) and configuration for the profile, messaging, notification and wallets.
- When you sign in to your profile on another device, that device immediately appears in the list of devices for syncing.
- If you have multiple profiles, you need to set up syncing for each one of them.

<Admonition type="info">
  Your password and messages are not part of your profile data. If you [change your password](./change-your-status-password.mdx) on one device, you need to manually update it on all devices where you use Status.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip">
  When you sync a new device, only the messages sent or received in the last 30 days are available on your new device. Messages you receive from that initial sync are always available.
</Admonition>

## Before you sync

To avoid issues when pairing and syncing your devices, follow these recommendations:

- Only sync two devices at a time.
- Both devices must have the Status app open and running with the profile you want to sync.
- Make sure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. You can set up syncing over mobile networks after the first sync.
- Disable any VPN or firewall on the network where the devices are connected.

<Admonition type="tip">
  After the first sync, your devices remain in sync even if they are on different networks.
</Admonition>

## Sync your profile

When setting up syncing, you need to reveal the QR code or sync code on the primary device and scan or enter the code on the other device. Sync codes and QR codes are only valid for a limited time. If the time expires, confirm your profile credentials again to get new one.

## Turn off profile syncing
