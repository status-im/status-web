title: Change your Status password

When you create a new Status profile, you set a password to protect your profile and Wallet accounts. You can change this password at any time.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Status doesn't know your password and cannot reset it for you. If you forget your password and don't have your recovery phrase, you lose access to your Status profile and Wallet accounts. Check out [If you lose your Status password or recovery phrase](./if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx) for more information.
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- To set a new password, you must know the current password.
- The password is profile-specific. It only works for the current profile if you have multiple profiles on your device.
- The password is device-specific. It only works for your current device. If you have logged in to your profile on multiple devices, the password for other devices remains unchanged.
- If you set up [syncing](./sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx) for your profile, your password is not synced across devices. For more information, check out [About changing your Status password](./about-changing-your-status-password.mdx).

<Admonition type="tip">
  After changing your password on one device, always update the password on each device where you use Status. This ensures all your devices stay secure and in sync.
