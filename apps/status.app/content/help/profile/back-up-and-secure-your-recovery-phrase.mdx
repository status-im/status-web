<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

Your Status recovery phrase (also known as a seed phrase or backup phrase) consists of 12 words that can be used to regenerate your [private key](./understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx). If you lose your private key or it is compromised, you lose access to your Status profile and funds forever. For this reason, you must always back up your recovery phrase and keep it safe.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Status can't recover your Status password or recovery phrase for you. It is your responsibility to keep this information safe. Check out [If you lose your Status password or recovery phrase](./if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx) for more information.

## Back up your recovery phrase

For security reasons, your recovery phrase is permanently removed from your device once you confirm that you have saved it. You won't be able to view your recovery phrase in the Status app after that (the option is greyed out).

## Secure your recovery phrase

If you lose your recovery phrase, or someone else gets access to it, you lose access to your Status profile and funds in the [Status Wallet](../wallet/status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.mdx).

Here are some tips on how to keep your recovery phrase secure:

{/* <p class="admonition-title">Screen reader tip</p>
  If you're using a screen reader, consider making an audio recording of your recovery phrase or asking someone you trust to do so. For extra security, you can come up with a short story that would include words from your recovery phrase in the right order, and ask someone you trust to record it for you. */}

- **Keep it safe** – Use a pen-and-paper backup, writing down your recovery phrase on a piece of paper and saving this paper in a locked safe, at the very least. This is the most common backup method, but it's not the most secure one. Consider using a hardware wallet in addition to your pen-and-paper backup.

- **Avoid digital copies** – Don't take a screenshot of your recovery phrase and don't save your recovery phrase on your phone, computer or any online services.

- **Never share** – Don't share the recovery phrase with anyone and be careful about who has access to it.

- **Use a hardware wallet** – Hardware wallets add an extra layer of security to your recovery phrase. The [Keycard hardware wallet](../keycard/keycard-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) integrates with the Status app and is compatible with all major cryptocurrencies.

- **Use multiple backups** – You can combine different backup methods, such as a pen-and-paper backup and a hardware wallet. In addition, you can improve the security of your pen-and-paper backup by dividing up your recovery phrase words and storing them in different places.

<Admonition type="info">
  Keep your recovery phrase safe and never share it with anyone. Status will never ask you for this information, and anyone who does is trying to steal your profile and wallet funds.
