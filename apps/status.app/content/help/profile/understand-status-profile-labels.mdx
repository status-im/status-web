In Status, you can label profiles as trusted or untrusted. This is useful when you want to quickly tell your contacts from possible impersonators.

Identity verification and profile labels help you remember whether you should trust someone without alerting them to your decision.

For example, if you're managing a corporate community and someone requests to join claiming to be an employee, you can try [verifying their identity](./verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx). If they fail to pass, you can mark them as untrusted but keep them in your contacts to understand who was trying to impersonate an employee and infiltrate your company's token-gated community.

  To see a label on someone's profile, [mark this profile as trusted or untrusted](../profile/verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx).

## The basics

- You can mark your contacts' Status profiles with two labels: trusted or untrusted.
- Only you can set and see these labels on your Status contacts' profiles. The person you mark doesn't see the label and isn't notified about your decision.
- These labels have no impact on your contact's status. For example, marking a contact as untrusted doesn't remove them from your contact list.

## Status profile labels

If you doubt your Status contact's identity, you can [send them an identity verification request](./verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx). In this request, you ask a question only this person can know the answer to.

Depending on their response, you then mark them as trusted or untrusted. Once you do, a label appears next to their profile name: <VerifiedIcon /> Trusted or <UntrustworthyIcon /> Untrusted.
