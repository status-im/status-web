<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.
</Admonition>

You can use your Status profile on multiple devices, like your phone and computer.

If you run Status on another device, sign in by [syncing your profile](./sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx). Otherwise, [use your recovery phrase or Keycard to sign in](#sign-in-using-your-recovery-phrase-or-keycard).

<Admonition type="info">
  You can sign in to your Status profile on a new device if you have used the profile in the past 30 days. If it's inactive for 30 days, first you have to sign in from the device you created the profile to recover it.
</Admonition>

## Sign in by syncing

If you already use Status on another device, [sync your profile to sign in](./sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx#sync-your-profile). By doing so, your profile is up to date on every device, and you can switch between them seamlessly. Without syncing, you are likely to set up the same options more than once and receive multiple notifications for one single message.

<Admonition type="info">
  Status syncs your password when you sign in by syncing, meaning that you can use your password on the new device. However, once the devices are in sync, if you [change your password](./change-your-status-password.mdx) on one device, you need to manually update it on all devices where you use the same Status profile. For more information, check out [About changing your Status password](./about-changing-your-status-password.mdx).
