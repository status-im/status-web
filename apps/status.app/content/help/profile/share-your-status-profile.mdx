<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

If someone wants to add you as a contact in Status, you need to share your profile with them. You can share your profile link or your QR code containing that link with your [chat key](./your-chatkey-emojihash-and-identicon-ring.mdx). They can use either of those to [add you to their contacts](../messaging/add-a-contact-in-status.mdx).
