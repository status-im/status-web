<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

If you want to export your Status Wallet accounts and use some other wallet app, you need your [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx). As long as you have your recovery phrase, you can import it into any wallet app that supports the 12-word format.

In Status, you can only view your recovery phrase once. After you [back up your recovery phrase](../profile/back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx), there's no way to view it again in your Status app. For security reasons, your recovery phrase is permanently deleted from your device. If you lost your backup, check out [If you lose your Status password or recovery phrase](../profile/if-you-lose-your-status-password-or-recovery-phrase.mdx).

<Admonition type="caution">
  If you lost your recovery phrase, consider [creating a new Status profile](../profile/create-and-use-additional-status-profiles.mdx). Without your recovery phrase, you can't restore access to your profile and wallet if you log out of Status on your current devices.
