<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.

WalletConnect is a secure way to connect your Wallet to [decentralized applications](./about-decentralized-apps-in-status-wallet.mdx) directly from the Status app, using a QR code or link.

<Admonition type="tip">
  In addition to WalletConnect, you can connect to dApps using the [Status Connector extension](./connect-to-dapps-using-status-connector.mdx) on your desktop browser.

Decentralized applications (also known as dApps, Dapps or web3 apps) are applications running on a [blockchain network](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx), such as Ethereum. Using dApps and your Status Wallet, you can interact with decentralized finance (DeFi), games, social networks and other blockchain-based services.

<Admonition type="info">
  WalletConnect is not developed or provided by Status and works with many other crypto wallets, not just Status Wallet. For more information, check the [WalletConnect website](https://walletconnect.network/)<ExternalIcon />.

## Why use WalletConnect

Using WalletConnect to interact with dApps has several advantages.

- **Simplicity**: WalletConnect uses a direct connection between your Status app and the dApp, so you don't need to install extra software or browser extensions.
- **Browser flexibility**: With WalletConnect and your Status Wallet, you can interact with dApps using any browser of your choice.
- **Cross-platform**: WalletConnect works on both your phone and computer, so you can access your favorite dApps from any device that uses Status.

<Admonition type="info">
  You need to have the Status app installed on your device to connect to dApps using the Status Wallet and WalletConnect.
