title: Import missing private keys and key pairs on multiple devices

When you [create your Status profile](../getting-started/run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time.mdx), the Status app automatically generates a master key (key pair) and a wallet account for you. This initial master key is securely linked to your profile recovery phrase and synchronized across your devices when you set up [profile synchronization](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx).

<Admonition type="info">
  In the Status app, the terms "master key" and "key pair" are sometimes used interchangeably. While they are not exactly the same, both represent a set of keys that protect your wallet accounts.
</Admonition>

When you [create a new master key](./organize-funds-and-accounts-with-a-new-master-key.mdx) (key pair) on one of your devices, the device stores the key locally. To reduce the risk of accidental exposure during synchronization, the Status app does not automatically sync these new keys across devices, even if your Status profile is synchronized.

## What to expect

- The Status app keeps your Status profile master key and all derived Wallet accounts synchronized across devices when you set up profile synchronization.
- If you [create additional accounts](./create-wallet-accounts.mdx) from a new master key or private key on one device, these are not automatically synchronized to your other devices.
- To access these accounts on a new device, you must import the private key or key pair from the device where you created them.
- On your [synced devices](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx), the Status app lists missing key pairs and accounts in Wallet settings to show they aren't available on the current device.

<Admonition type="tip">
  Importing key pairs and private keys on all your devices simplifies managing your funds and accounts, but it is not mandatory. You can choose to keep some key on specific devices.

## Import missing private keys and key pairs

To import missing private keys and key pairs across devices, you must complete these steps on each device that is missing the keys.

## Add the missing Wallet keys manually

The Status app shows the missing master keys and key pairs on your [synced devices](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx). On devices that aren't synced with your Status profile, the missing keys don't appear, but you can add them manually.

For information on how to add missing keys manually, read [Import an account into your Status Wallet](./import-an-account-into-your-status-wallet.mdx).

## Find the QR code for your keys

To import a key pair or private key from another device, you need to find the corresponding encrypted QR code.

Complete these steps on the device where you added the key pair or private key.
