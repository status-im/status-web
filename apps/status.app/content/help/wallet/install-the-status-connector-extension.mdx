[Status Connector](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kahehnbpamjplefhpkhafinaodkkenpg)<ExternalIcon /> is an open-source browser extension that you can use to connect to decentralized applications (dApps) directly from your desktop browser.

You can use Status Connector with Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers, such as Brave, Edge or Opera.

## Why use Status Connector

While [WalletConnect](https://walletconnect.network/)<ExternalIcon /> uses QR codes or deep links to establish a connection, Status Connector provides a direct link between your browser and the Status desktop app. This eliminates the need to scan QR codes and simplifies connecting to dApps and signing transactions.

<Admonition type="info">
  Status Connector is available for the desktop browser only and requires the Status desktop app. If you need to connect to dApps on your mobile device, [use WalletConnect](./connect-to-dapps-using-walletconnect.mdx).
