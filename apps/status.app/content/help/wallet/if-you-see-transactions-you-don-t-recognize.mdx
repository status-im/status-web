  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.

If there are transactions in your Wallet history for amounts you don't remember spending, it may mean someone else has access to your wallet.

Double-check your transaction history using a block explorer. For more details on how to use block explorers, check out [Understand block explorers](./understand-block-explorers.mdx). If you see the same transactions both in your Status Wallet app and the block explorer, you need to act as fast as possible to protect your money.

## Transfer your remaining funds to a new Wallet

If you have any crypto left in your current wallet, create a new Status profile and transfer your remaining crypto to your new Wallet. Your Status profile and your Wallet account are not the same thing. Your Status profile also includes your chats and communities, and you can have multiple Wallet accounts on the same Status profile.

Creating a new Wallet account in your Status app is not enough, as all Wallet accounts that belong to your profile share the same recovery phrase. If this recovery phrase was compromised, all of your Wallet accounts can be at risk. Whoever has your recovery phrase can also access your contact list, chats and communities. If someone has your recovery phrase, they can access everything you do in Status and act on your behalf. For example, they can message your contacts.

<Admonition type="caution">
  If you think someone has your recovery phrase, you must stop using the Status profile associated with that recovery phrase. Create a new one instead.

  1. **Learn more about how to protect your crypto**. Understand what your recovery phrase is and [how to store it](../profile/back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx). Anyone with your recovery phrase can access your crypto and your Status profile. That is why you should keep your recovery phrase in a safe place and never share it with anyone.
  1. **Be careful with downloading new apps**. No matter which platform you're using, double-check every app or browser extension you install. Make sure it's from a reputable source. If in doubt, check the app's website to verify you're downloading the official version. Unverified or suspicious apps may contain viruses or other malware that can steal your crypto wallet data.
  1. **Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks**. As a rule, consider any public network (such as airport or coffee shops) unsafe. If you have digital copies of your recovery phrase on your phone (for example, screenshots), malicious users may see them. They may also have access to your internet traffic and target you if they notice anything crypto-related. To protect yourself, always use a VPN when you connect to an unprotected public WiFi network.
