SNT is a fixed-supply ERC-20 token on the Ethereum network, and the token of the Status ecosystem.

The SNT token is part of our greater aspirations and political aims, as described in our [manifesto](https://status.app/manifesto). We seek to defend the freedom of speech worldwide, uphold human rights and help people preserve their right to privacy.

## The utility of the SNT token

The SNT token was [launched](https://messari.io/asset/status)<ExternalIcon /> in 2017 to promote a decentralized and user-governed ecosystem. This is in contrast to other crypto assets that might lack utility beyond value transfer or speculative investment.

All SNT holders can use their tokens to [vote for communities](#vote-for-communities) and [proposals](#vote-for-proposals)<ExternalIcon />, as well as [create ENS names](#create-ens-names). To vote, connect an Ethereum wallet that contains SNT to the voting app. If you're using Status Wallet, see [Connect to dApps using WalletConnect](./connect-to-dapps-using-walletconnect.mdx) for more details.

### Vote for communities

As an SNT holder, you can vote for Communities to be featured in the Status app Community Directory. This helps communities gain more visibility, grow and attract new members.

For more details, see [Vote to feature a Status Community](../communities/about-voting-to-change-the-community-visibility.mdx).

### Vote for proposals

You can propose and vote for projects you want Status to work on. Proposals aren't just new app features: they're various social initiatives Status could start or invest in.

All proposals start with a forum post in the [Status Discussions forum](https://discuss.status.app/c/proposals/77)<ExternalIcon /> and are moved to the Governance app once they're mature enough.

For more details, see [Proposals](https://governance.status.app)<ExternalIcon />.

### Create ENS names

You can lock up 10 SNT to [register an ENS name](../profile/register-an-ens-name-in-status.mdx) on our ENS domain (_yourname_.stateofus.eth) or your own custom .eth domain.

This name replaces your default three-word long name in the Status app. Instead of sharing your Ethereum address (which starts with 0x), you can give people this alternative for sending you crypto.

If you change your mind about the name, you can cancel it and get your 10 SNT back after one year of use.
