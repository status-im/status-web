title: Organize funds and accounts with a new master key

A master key (or key pair) is a unique identifier that controls multiple accounts in your Status Wallet.

By default, Status generates a master key when you create your Status profile. This master key is used to create your first Wallet account and is linked to your recovery phrase.

<Admonition type="tip">
  Using the recovery phrase, you can restore all wallet accounts created under the linked master key.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  In the Status app, the terms "master key" and "key pair" are sometimes used interchangeably. While they are not exactly the same, you can think of both as representing a set of keys that protect your wallet account.
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- When you create your Status profile, Status generates a unique master key (key pair). This master key derives from your recovery phrase and is used to create your first Wallet account.
- You can create additional master keys, each with its own recovery phrase. These additional keys help you organize your funds and accounts to fit your needs.
- You can create a new master key by importing a recovery phrase you own (for example, one generated by another wallet) or by generating a new recovery phrase.

<Admonition type="info">
  Adding new master keys can make managing your crypto funds more complex. Each master key comes with its own recovery phrase that you must [back up](./back-up-your-wallet-accounts.mdx) and store separately.

## Why create a new master key?

Creating new master keys (key pairs) is optional. You can continue using the default master key for all your accounts if you prefer.

A new master key can be useful for different reasons:

- **Organize your funds**: You can create a new master key to separate your funds and accounts for different purposes, such as personal and business use.
- **Privacy**: Blockchain transactions are publicly visible. By using a new master key, you create a new set of addresses, making it harder to link your transactions to your identity.
- **Importing external wallets**: You can import an existing wallet into Status Wallet using your recovery phrase. This is useful if you want to manage multiple wallets within the Status app.
