To receive crypto, you need to share your Ethereum address with the sender. As long as you only share your public address (which starts with `0x` and is 42 characters long), it's perfectly safe.

<Admonition type="caution">
  You should never share your 12-word recovery phrase with anyone. Anyone who has your recovery phrase can manage your crypto. If someone's asking for your recovery phrase to send you crypto, they're trying to scam you.

## What to do if you don't receive your crypto

If someone sent you crypto and you can't see it in your Status Wallet, here's what you can do:

- Ask the sender to share a [block explorer](./understand-block-explorers.mdx) link for this transaction with you. Using the link, make sure they sent your crypto to the right address.
- If the transaction shows up as [processing or pending](./understand-transaction-confirmations-and-statuses.mdx) on the block explorer or your Wallet <ContextTag>Activity</ContextTag> tab, simply wait until it's completed. This can take longer than usual when the network's busy.
- Close and re-open your Status Wallet app.
- Check your internet connection. If you're using a VPN, try turning it off and on again.
