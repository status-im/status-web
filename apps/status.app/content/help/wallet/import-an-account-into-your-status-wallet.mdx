<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

To use your existing wallet account with Status Wallet, import either your recovery phrase or private key. Both options are valid, but they work differently:

- A recovery phrase restores all the accounts created with that phrase.
- A private key (a secret code represented by a string of characters) only restores a specific account.

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only import accounts with a private key using the Status desktop app.
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- A recovery phrase may contain more than one wallet account. When you import a recovery phrase into Status Wallet, the app imports all the accounts but displays only the first one.
- To display all the accounts from your recovery phrase, you need to add them individually. For more information, check out [Add missing accounts after importing a wallet](./add-missing-accounts-after-importing-a-wallet.mdx).
- You can import a maximum of five recovery phrases or private keys in your Status Wallet.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Never share your private key with anyone. Whoever has your private key can access and manage your crypto. Status will never ask you for your key, and anyone who does is trying to steal your profile and wallet funds.
