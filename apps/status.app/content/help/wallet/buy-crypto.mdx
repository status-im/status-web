## Buy crypto: FAQ

### Are crypto purchases handled by Status?

No. When you're buying crypto in Status, you're buying from our partners through their sites. If you have any issues or questions, please contact the support team of the partner you bought crypto from (Ramp or MoonPay).

### Why did I receive a different amount than I expected?

An asset exchange rate is always changing and fluctuating, and blockchain transactions take some time to be processed. If the network is particularly busy while you're placing your order, it can take longer for your transaction to go through.

This can sometimes lead to you receiving more or less than the amount you were expecting. If you have any issues or questions, please contact the support team of the partner you bought crypto from (Ramp or MoonPay).

### Does Status charge any fees for buying crypto?

Yes. When buying crypto, you are charged a network fee and a processing fee. The network fee is charged by the blockchain, and our partners must pay this fee to send you your crypto.

The processing fee is charged by Status and our partners. The exact fee amount depends on the partner, and it may vary depending on the fiat currency you're using and the payment method.
