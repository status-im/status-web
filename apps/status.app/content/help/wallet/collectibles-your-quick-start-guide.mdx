<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

Collectibles (also known as non-fungible tokens or NFTs) are unique digital assets in [the blockchain](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx) that you can own, use or trade. These tokens often represent ownership of artistic or virtual items.

in Status, collectibles can also provide access to certain token-gated communities or exclusive content within designated channels. For example, you may need a collectible to [join a community](../communities/join-a-status-community.mdx) that requires it for access.

<Admonition type="tip">
  To join a token-gated community or channel requiring a collectible, ensure you [share the Status Wallet account](../communities/choose-the-wallet-account-address-you-share-with-a-community.mdx) holding the collectible with the community.

## Work with collectibles

You can [mint collectibles for your community](../communities/mint-tokens-for-your-community.mdx) as a community Owner or TokenMaster.

When you mint a collectible, you create a unique digital token that serves your community's needs, such as [rewarding members](../communities/how-to-airdrop-tokens-in-status.mdx), [token-gate your community](../communities/set-up-a-token-gated-community.mdx) or granting [exclusive access](../communities/grant-exclusive-access-with-tokens.mdx) to channels.
