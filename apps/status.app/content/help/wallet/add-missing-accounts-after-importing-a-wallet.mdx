title: Add missing accounts after importing a wallet

When you [import a wallet](./import-an-account-into-your-status-wallet.mdx) with multiple accounts into Status, you may notice that some accounts are missing. Similar to what other crypto wallets do after importing, Status Wallet only shows the first account.

All the accounts in the wallet you import are available in Status Wallet but are not visible. To view and operate these missing accounts you need to [add them manually](#add-missing-accounts-after-importing-a-wallet) after importing the wallet.

## What to expect

- When you import a wallet with multiple accounts, only the first account is visible in Status Wallet.
- You can add the missing accounts to Status Wallet by adding additional accounts using the same recovery phrase origin.
- If you can't find your account after importing and adding extra accounts, you may need to [edit the derivation path](./create-a-wallet-account-with-a-custom-derivation-path.mdx). Check if the original wallet uses a different path or shows the one used for the missing account.

<Admonition type="info">
  Status Wallet uses the [BIP44 standard](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki)<ExternalIcon /> for derivation paths. Check out [How wallet accounts, keys, and derivation paths work](./how-wallet-accounts-keys-and-derivation-paths-work.mdx) for more information.

## Add missing accounts after importing a wallet

To add the missing accounts after importing a wallet, create additional accounts using the same recovery phrase.

<AwaitedList>
  - [Import the wallet](./import-an-account-into-your-status-wallet.mdx) if you haven't done so already. After importing, only the first account is visible in Status Wallet.
  - Using the same recovery phrase as the account origin, [create additional accounts](./create-wallet-accounts.mdx). The Status app adds the missing accounts using consecutive derivation paths.
  - If you or your wallet provider have used a different derivation path standard, you may need to [edit the derivation path](./create-a-wallet-account-with-a-custom-derivation-path.mdx) to access your missing accounts.

## Example importing multiple accounts from MetaMask

Let's say you have a wallet in MetaMask with three accounts (accounts 1, 2, 3), and you want to import the accounts into Status Wallet.

Internally, these accounts use a sequence of numbers and symbols to represent their derivation paths, following the BIP44 standard.

- Account 1: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`
- Account 2: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/1`
- Account 3: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/2`

During the import process, Status Wallet shows the first account derivation path, `m/44'/60'/0'/0/0`.

To view the other two accounts, create two additional accounts using the same recovery phrase origin. Status Wallet automatically adds the missing accounts using consecutive derivation paths, `m/44'/60'/0'/0/1` and `m/44'/60'/0'/0/2`.

After adding the accounts, you can view and operate them in Status Wallet.

<Admonition type="tip">
  You typically don't need to edit or worry about derivation paths. Only if the account you're importing into Status Wallet uses a different derivation path than the standard one, you may need to [edit the derivation path](./create-a-wallet-account-with-a-custom-derivation-path.mdx) to access the account.
