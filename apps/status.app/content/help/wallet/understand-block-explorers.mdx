Block explorers are tools you can use to browse blockchain data. With block explorers, you can learn more about any transaction that was made on the blockchain.

Since all [Ethereum blockchain](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx) data is public and pseudonymous, it doesn't matter whose transactions you're exploring. You can view the details of both your own and others' transactions.

Block explorers are network-specific. This means that for [bridge transactions](./bridge-crypto-in-status-wallet.mdx), you need to use two or more different block explorers, one for each chain. In your Status Wallet, you can find the Bridge field and transaction hashes for each chain. For more details, check out [Understand your transaction details](./understand-your-transaction-details.mdx).

## Use block explorers

To get started with block explorers, copy your address and look it up on a block explorer of your choice. For example, you can use [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [Blockchair](https://blockchair.com/ethereum/) or [beaconcha.in](https://beaconcha.in/) for the Ethereum mainnet. If you're using [an L2 or a sidechain](./understand-l2s-and-sidechains.mdx), you need to find a block explorer for this network.

## Explore transaction data

You can usually find the data below on all block explorers. This list isn't comprehensive. For more details, check out your block explorer's documentation.

      <TableCell>
        Only change this value if you know what you're doing. Using the wrong nonce can cause your transaction to fail.

        Changing the nonce lets you control the order of your transactions. You can prepare a transaction for later execution or speed up a stuck one.

        The nonce is a number that determines the order of transactions sent from your wallet. {/* You can use nonces to cancel or resend transactions that are still processing. For more details, check out [Cancel transactions](./cancel-transactions.mdx) and [Handle pending or stuck transactions](./handle-pending-or-stuck-transactions.mdx). */}
