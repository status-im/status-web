In Status Wallet, you can only withdraw your crypto to your bank account through a third-party platform.

## Withdraw crypto to your bank account

To withdraw your crypto, you need to create an account on a third-party exchange platform and then send a transaction from your Status Wallet address to your exchange platform address.

### Step 1: Create an account on the platform of your choice

The most popular exchange platforms include [Kraken](https://kraken.com), [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com) and [Binance](https://binance.com). You can choose one of those or any other that's available in your jurisdiction.

Depending on your location, you may also have crypto ATMs and physical exchanges around you. Like using online platforms, you need to send a crypto transaction from your Status Wallet to a crypto ATM or an in-person exchange.
