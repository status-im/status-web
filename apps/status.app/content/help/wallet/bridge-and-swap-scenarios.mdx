<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

In the Status app, you can bridge or swap crypto assets. When you bridge, you transfer assets between different blockchains. For example, you can move USDS from Ethereum to Optimism using a bridge. In a swap, you exchange one cryptocurrency for another. For example, you can swap USDS for SNT.

<Admonition type="tip">
  The key difference between bridging and swapping is that bridging transfers assets between blockchains, while swapping exchanges one virtual coin for another.
</Admonition>

Here are some scenarios you can encounter when deciding whether to bridge or swap crypto assets.
