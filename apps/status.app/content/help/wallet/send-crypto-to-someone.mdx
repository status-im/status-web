You can send crypto to other people using your [Status Wallet](./status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.mdx). The person you're sending crypto to doesn't need to be a Status Wallet user.

<Admonition type="info">
  Status Wallet doesn't charge any extra transaction fees. The network fees you're paying to send transactions are charged by the Ethereum blockchain. For more details, check out [Understand network fees](./understand-network-fees.mdx).
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- You can send crypto to any Ethereum address. This means the person receiving your crypto doesn't need to be on your contact list. They can also use any other wallet app they prefer.
- Status Wallet doesn't support non-Ethereum-based assets. If you send crypto to a non-Ethereum address (for example, a Bitcoin address), you may lose your funds. To verify the address, you can look it up on a [block explorer](./understand-block-explorers.mdx).
- To send crypto to someone, you need to pay network fees. No matter which asset or token you're sending, you can only pay network fees in ETH. For more details, check out [Understand network fees](./understand-network-fees.mdx).
