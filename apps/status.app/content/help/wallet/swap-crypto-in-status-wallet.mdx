<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only swap on the Status desktop app.
</Admonition>

By swapping, you exchange one asset for another, often for investment purposes, to obtain specific tokens or to access a community with particular token requirements. For example, you can swap ETH for [SNT](./about-the-status-snt-token.mdx) to join a Status Community that [requires you to hold](../communities/understand-token-requirements-in-communities.mdx) SNT.

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you want to move your asset to another blockchain network, see [Bridge crypto in Status Wallet](./bridge-crypto-in-status-wallet.mdx) instead. If you are unsure about the option to use, see [Choose between bridging and swapping assets](./bridge-and-swap-scenarios.mdx).
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- In Status Wallet, you can swap ERC-20 assets on Ethereum Mainnet, Arbitrum and Optimism blockchains.
- You can only swap assets (virtual coins), not collectibles (NFTs).
- You can set the maximum slippage to accept when swapping. If the slippage is set too low, the transaction may fail.
- You need to pay a swap fee, which is automatically deducted from the amount you're swapping. You pay the fee to the blockchain that hosts your assets and the swap service, not Status. For more details, check out [About swap and bridge fees](./about-swap-and-bridge-fees.mdx).

<Admonition type="info">
  Slippage is the difference between the expected price of the swap and the actual price at which it is executed. It defines how much price movement you accept before the swap fails.
