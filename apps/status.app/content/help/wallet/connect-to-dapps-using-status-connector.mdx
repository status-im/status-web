[Status Connector](./install-the-status-connector-extension.mdx) is a browser extension that you can use to securely connect to decentralized applications (dApps) directly from your desktop browser.

<Admonition type="info">
  Status Connector is an extension developed and provided by Status that works with the Status desktop Wallet. To install it, check out [Install the Status Connector extension](./install-the-status-connector-extension.mdx).
</Admonition>

Decentralized applications (also known as dApps, Dapps or web3 apps) are applications running on a [blockchain network](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx), such as Ethereum. Using dApps and your Status Wallet, you can interact with decentralized finance (DeFi), games, social networks and other blockchain-based services.

<Admonition type="tip">
  In addition to the Status Connector, you can connect to dApps using [WalletConnect](./connect-to-dapps-using-walletconnect.mdx) on Status desktop and mobile.
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- You can configure the Status Connector extension as the default wallet for your browser. To do this, click the extension and enable the <ContextTag>Set as default wallet</ContextTag> option.
- If you want to connect to a dApp using other wallets in your browser, disable the Status Connector extension as the default wallet.
- To administer your connected dApps, use the Status desktop app. For more information, check out [Administer your Wallet dApp connections](./administer-your-wallet-dapp-connections.mdx).
