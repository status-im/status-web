<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="info">
  Currently, you can only request a crypto payment using the Status desktop app.
</Admonition>

In the Status app, you can request a crypto payment from someone through direct messages, group chats or community channels. Use this feature to receive payments for your work, collect contributions for community projects or get paid for goods and services.

The person receiving your request should only click on it to complete the payment.

## What to expect

- You can request a crypto payment from contacts and non-contacts.
- You can only request payments in crypto assets (virtual coins), not collectibles (NFTs).
- In the Status app, you can request payments in ERC-20 assets using Ethereum or any of the [Layer-2 networks](./lower-your-fees-with-layer-2-networks.mdx) supported by Status.
- When your payment request is completed, you receive a notification of the incoming payment to your Status Wallet.
