<Admonition type="beta" status="Experimental">
  Replacing your community's control node is an experimental feature.
</Admonition>

{/*
  See [Support archive protocol when transferring control node to new device/account](https://github.com/status-im/status-desktop/issues/15235).
*/}

The [community's control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx) maintains your community settings, configuration and functionality. The computer where you [create your Status Community](./create-a-status-community.mdx) or [transfer your community's ownership](./transfer-your-community-s-ownership.mdx) becomes a control node.

As a community owner, you can replace the control node if you need to move your community to another computer. You can only replace the control node if you meet all these conditions:

- Have access to the computer where your community runs.
- Replace the control node within 30 days of the last time your community connected to the internet.
- Have the [Owner token](./understand-the-owner-and-tokenmaster-tokens.mdx) in your Status Wallet.

<Admonition type="info">
  If the control node is unavailable, read [Recover your Status Community](./recover-your-status-community.mdx).
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- Before replacing the control node, [Mint the Owner token](./mint-the-owner-and-tokenmaster-tokens.mdx).
- After replacing the control node, [remove the original Status desktop installation](#remove-status-desktop-from-the-original-control-node) to avoid issues with your community.
- In the new control node, members can only access messages from the past 30 days. Older messages, managed by the [Community History Service (CHS)](./about-the-community-history-service.mdx), are not available on the new control node.
- Keep only one control node running. Trying to run your community with more than one control node can cause unforeseen issues.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Every Status desktop installation includes the Status folder. Don't delete or change this folder. Doing so may cause unexpected issues with your community and Status profile.
</Admonition>

## Replace your community's control node

You start the process in the current control node and finish it in the new one.

    ### Step 1: Initiate control node replacement

    1. In the new computer, install Status desktop and sign in with your Owner's profile by syncing, entering your recovery phrase or using your Keycard.
    1. The current control node notifies you about a new device added to your profile. In the control node, go to <ContextTag icon={<SettingsDesktopIcon />}>Settings</ContextTag> > <ContextTag icon={<RotateDesktopIcon />}>Syncing</ContextTag> and click <ContextTag>Setup syncing</ContextTag> next to your new computer. Wait for the synchronization to finish.
    1. Still in the current control node, in your community settings, click <ContextTag icon={<ShowDesktopIcon />}>Overview</ContextTag>. Under the content area, click <ContextTag>How to move control node</ContextTag>.
    1. Select the new computer as the control node and click <ContextTag>Move control node</ContextTag>.

    ### Step 2: Finalise control node replacement

    1. In the new computer, click your community in the navigation sidebar.
    1. At the top of the channel sidebar, click your community logo and then click <ContextTag icon={<ShowDesktopIcon />}>Overview</ContextTag>.
    1. Under the content area, click <ContextTag>Make this device the control node</ContextTag>.
    1. Check the required boxes and click <ContextTag>Make this device the control node for \[your-community]</ContextTag>

## Turn on the Community History Service (optional)

After you replace your control node on another computer, the new control node shows only the last 30 days of messages. To maintain message history beyond 30 days on the new control node, you need to enable the [Community History Service (CHS)](./about-the-community-history-service.mdx).

<Admonition type="info">
  Enabling the Community History Service on the new control node doesn't restore the message history from the previous control node.

To turn on the Community History Service:
