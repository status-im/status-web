<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

In Status, there are two kinds of communities: open and token-gated. If you want to [join a token-gated community](./join-a-status-community.mdx), you need to meet the token requirements the community Owner sets. To maintain access to a token-gated community, always hold the necessary tokens.

The Status app has three kinds of tokens: assets, collectibles and ENS (Ethereum Name Service) names. Community Owners can set up any combination of these tokens as a requirement to join their communities.

<Admonition type="info">
  When you join a token-gated community, the token or tokens required to join are not transferred to anyone. They are used only for verification purposes and remain in your possession and wallet.
</Admonition>

## How the Status app checks your tokens

When you join a community (either open or token-gated), you [share one or more](./choose-the-wallet-account-address-you-share-with-a-community.mdx) of your Status Wallet accounts with the [community's control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx). If you join a token-gated community, the Status app considers the tokens you hold across all your shared accounts.

For example, a community Owner can set up owning 10 SNT as a requirement to join their community. In that example, you can join the community by owning a minimum of 10 SNT in one of your shared Wallet accounts or a combination of shared accounts.

<Admonition type="info">
  Your Wallet account addresses and tokens are never revealed to the community Owner or members.
</Admonition>

## If you meet the token requirements

Before you join a token-gated community, the Status app automatically checks if you meet the community requirements. If you meet the requirements, the option to join the community is available.

<Admonition type="info">
  If the community Owner has set [manual approval](./set-up-your-community-join-requests.mdx) option for their community, you still need the owner's approval to join.
</Admonition>

## If you don't meet the token requirements

If the option to join the community is greyed out and unavailable, you don't meet the token requirements to join the community. To apply to join the community, you must hold the required token amount.

<Admonition type="tip">
  To buy the necessary tokens, check out [Buy crypto](../wallet/buy-crypto.mdx).
