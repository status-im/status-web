<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.

With Status, you can organize your conversations with community members into [channels](./channels-your-quick-start-guide.mdx). Channels bring the right people and information together for a common purpose, like a specific project or topic.

All members of a [community](./how-to-use-status-communities-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) can browse and join open channels. For token-gated channels, you must [meet the requirements](./understand-token-requirements-in-channels.mdx) to join the channel. To maintain access to token-gated channels, always hold the necessary tokens.

## Join an open channel

All members can join channels that don't have a <LockedIcon /> lock symbol next to their names. When you join a community, you automatically get access to these channels.
