Use a [throwaway profile](./understand-throwaway-profiles-in-status-web.mdx) when you want to participate in a Status Web Community without revealing your identity. A throwaway profile is not linked to any identifiable information or other Status profile you may have.

## Use a throwaway profile

<Tabs defaultValue="Web">
  <TabsList size={32}>
    <TabsTrigger value="Web">
      Web
    </TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>

  <TabsContent value="Web">
    1. Using your browser, open the Status Web Community you want to join.
    1. From the Community sidebar, click <ContextTag>Use throwaway profile</ContextTag>.
    1. If you see the <ContextTag>Throwaway profile found</ContextTag> pop-up, click <ContextTag>Load throwaway profile</ContextTag> to use the existing profile or click <ContextTag>Skip</ContextTag> to create a new one.
    1. In the top-right corner, click <ContextTag icon={<MembersIcon />}>Members</ContextTag>. Your throwaway profile name appears on the members sidebar.
  </TabsContent>
</Tabs>

## Disconnect your throwaway profile

The throwaway profile information remains in your browser cache and persists across browser sessions and computer restarts. To delete this information, disconnect your profile.

<Tabs defaultValue="Web">
  <TabsList size={32}>
    <TabsTrigger value="Web">
      Web
    </TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>

  <TabsContent value="Web">
    1. From the right sidebar, click <ContextTag icon={<LogOutIcon />}>logout</ContextTag> next to your profile name.
    1. On the <ContextTag>Disconnect</ContextTag> pop-up, click <ContextTag>Disconnect</ContextTag>.

## Common questions

### What are the three words in my profile?

These words represent your throwaway profile and identity in Status Web. These are randomly generated words.

### Is my throwaway profile really anonymous?

A throwaway profile protects your real identity while using Status Web. However, your internet service provider and browser can still collect identifiable information (like your IP address). Status doesn't collect information about you or your activity.

### Where is the throwaway profile information stored?

Your browser cache stores your throwaway profile. You can delete this information by disconnecting your profile, clearing the cache, or using your browser in incognito or private mode.

### I accidentally deleted my throwaway profile. Can I recover it?

No. Deleting a throwaway profile is an irreversible process.

### Can I use more than one throwaway profile?

There is only one throwaway profile per browser. If you want to use a new throwaway profile, delete the existing one or use a different browser.
