<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

You can lose your Status Community membership for different reasons. For example, a [token-gated community](./about-the-different-types-of-status-communities.mdx) can change the token requirements to join, or your behaviour breaks the community rules.

The community Owner can [ban or kick](./kick-or-ban-someone-from-your-community.mdx) your Status profile if you break the community rules. Respect the community rules and members, and don't spam people or promote scams or deceptive practices.

## The basics

- If you lose access to a community, you must request to [join the community](./join-a-status-community.mdx) again.
- For token-gated communities, you should hold the token requirements at all times.
- When the community Owner bans you or kicks you out, you can see <ContextTag>Banned</ContextTag> or <ContextTag>Kicked</ContextTag> in the community page.
- If the community Owner bans you from their community, you can't see or search for the community in the [Discover communities](./how-to-use-status-communities-your-quick-start-guide.mdx#discover-communities) page.
- In the [notifications centre](../profile/view-notifications-and-updates.mdx), your <ContextTag>Membership</ContextTag> notifications show when you lose access to a community. You don't receive a notification when you're banned from a community.

<Admonition type="info">
  Community Owners control who has access to their communities. Status can't kick you out or ban you from a community. Likewise, Status can't grant you access to a community or override the community Owner's actions.
