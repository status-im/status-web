title: About the management roles in Status Communities

Three roles collaborate in the Status Community administration and maintenance tasks: Owner, TokenMaster and Admin.

Users who create a community in Status receive the Owner role automatically. Community Owners can designate other users as TokenMasters or Admins.

  A community can have just one Owner, but multiple Admins and TokenMasters can exist.

As a community Owner, you don't have to appoint TokenMasters and Admins, but they can be helpful if you're managing a large community or event. For example, Admins can help moderate the community and TokenMasters can create tokens and set permissions.

## The basics

- When you create a community, you automatically become the Owner. Owners can perform every action within the community, including [minting and airdropping TokenMaster tokens](./mint-the-owner-and-tokenmaster-tokens.mdx) to other users' wallets.
- Users with a TokenMaster token in their wallet become TokenMasters when they accept the role. They can [mint new tokens](./mint-tokens-for-your-community.mdx) (except the Owner's token and TokenMaster tokens) and [set permissions](./set-up-your-community-permissions.mdx).
- Admins have fewer privileges than TokenMasters and the Owner. They can [moderate the community](./kick-or-ban-someone-from-your-community.mdx) and accept or reject [membership requests](./about-community-request-approvals.mdx) but can't create tokens or change permissions.
  Only community owners can appoint other members as TokenMasters or Admins, while TokenMasters can only appoint Admins. Community members can accept or decline these roles.

## Management roles comparison

You can see the differences between the three management roles below. To learn more about all roles, including those of regular members, check out [Permissions by role in Status Communities](./permissions-by-role-in-status-communities.mdx).
