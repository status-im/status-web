title: Revoke the TokenMaster role from someone
author: jorge-campo, cheny0, osmaczko
---

In Status Communities, Owners can grant the [TokenMaster role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) to others by airdropping them the TokenMaster token. The TokenMaster role in a community is optional, but it can help Owners administer the community tokens, membership and permissions.

When you [airdrop the TokenMaster token](./how-to-airdrop-the-tokenmaster-token.mdx) to someone, they become a TokenMaster and [gain administrative privileges](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) in your community. To revoke this role, you remotely destruct the TokenMaster token in their wallet.

<Admonition type="info">
  To revoke other types of tokens, read [Revoke a community token from someone](./revoke-a-community-token-from-someone.mdx).
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- Destructing the TokenMaster token is a built-in feature of this token, and it's available to community Owners only.
- When you revoke the TokenMaster token, it disappears from the recipient's wallet, and they lose the TokenMaster role immediately. The user receives a notification informing them of your action.
- Community Owners can always destruct the TokenMaster token, even if the token holder is not a community member.
- To revoke the TokenMaster token, you execute a transaction in the [Ethereum blockchain](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx) and pay a [gas fee](../wallet/understand-network-fees.mdx).
- If you revoke the TokenMaster role from someone by mistake or change your mind, you can airdrop a new TokenMaster token to them.
