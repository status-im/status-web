title: Revoke a community token from someone

[Community Owners and TokenMasters](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) can revoke tokens from community and non-community members by remotely destructing the token.

Depending on the token you revoke, the user may lose access to certain privileges or roles in the community. For example, if you revoke a token you minted and this token is required to be a member of your [token-gated community](./token-based-access-to-communities-and-channels.mdx), the user loses access to the community.

Only Community Owners can revoke the TokenMaster token. To learn how to do that, see [Revoke the TokenMaster role from someone](./revoke-the-tokenmaster-role-from-someone.mdx).

## What to expect

- Owners and TokenMasters can revoke any community token they granted, even if the user is not a community member.
- You can only revoke collectibles (NFTs) you minted for the community.
- When you revoke the token remotely, it disappears from the owner's Wallet. The user receives a notification telling them you revoked their token.
- The Status app tracks the current token owner. If you send a non-soulbound token to someone and they pass it on, revoking the token will remove it from the latest token holder.
- Destructing a token is a transaction on the [Ethereum blockchain](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx), so you need to pay a [gas fee](../wallet/understand-network-fees.mdx) to complete the transaction.

  Destructing a token is not the same as burning all the remaining token supply. For more information, check out [Burn your community tokens](./burn-your-community-tokens.mdx).
