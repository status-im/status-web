  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.

[Airdropping tokens](./how-to-airdrop-tokens-in-status.mdx) on Ethereum, Arbitrum or Optimism involves differences in transaction costs, speed and ease of use.

Airdropping on Layer-2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism can be faster and more cost-effective, but you need to make sure the airdrop recipients have wallets on those networks.

<Admonition type="info">
  Status Wallet supports the [Ethereum](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx), Arbitrum and Optimism [Layer-2 networks](../wallet/lower-your-fees-with-layer-2-networks.mdx). You can airdrop tokens on any of them.

## The basics

- When you create an airdrop campaign, the Status app uses the network the token is available on. If the asset (virtual coin) or collectible (NFT) exists on multiple networks, you can choose which network to use for the airdrop.
- Ethereum is the most established network with the largest user base, but it can be slow and expensive when the network is busy. If your airdrop is time-sensitive, Ethereum might not be the best choice.
- Layer-2 solutions are generally better for airdrops involving many recipients due to their scalability and lower fees.
- If you run an airdrop campaign on the Arbitrum or Optimism networks, the airdrop recipients must have a crypto wallet that supports these networks.

## Choose the right network for your airdrop

Before launching your airdrop, consider how easy it will be for users to receive and use the tokens. During the airdrop, you distribute the tokens on the same network they're available on. For example, if the tokens are on Arbitrum, the airdrop participants need a wallet that supports Arbitrum to receive or send them.

Users who receive assets or collectibles on Layer-2 networks like Arbitrum or Optimism can hold them on these networks. If they want to transfer these tokens to Ethereum for different reasons, they need to [bridge their tokens](../wallet/bridge-crypto-in-status-wallet.mdx).

  Bridging is the process of transferring assets between different blockchains, such as from a Layer-2 network back to Ethereum.

It takes more time to withdraw tokens on Arbitrum and Optimism compared to Ethereum. It doesn't matter whether you're moving them to a different platform or converting them into fiat, such as USD, EUR or JPY.

## Airdrop network comparison

To choose a network to airdrop tokens, consider the trade-offs between cost, speed and ease of use. This table summarizes the main differences between the networks supported by Status:

  While Ethereum has implemented several upgrades to improve scalability and reduce gas fees, it still faces high fees, particularly during periods of high network congestion.
