[Channels](./channels-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) are spaces for conversation, discussion and information sharing. By default, all community members with access to a channel can read and send messages.

As a community [owner or admin](./permissions-by-role-in-status-communities.mdx), you can set a channel as view-only. To learn how to do that, check out [Set up a view-only channel](./set-up-a-view-only-channel.mdx).

## The basics

- A view-only channel helps maintain clear, uninterrupted communication for specific purposes. While members can't respond directly in these channels, they are crucial in keeping your community informed and engaged.
- When you [set up a channel permission](set-up-your-channel-permissions.mdx), only members who meet the criteria for that permission can perform the associated action within that channel.
- Members with the token required to post in a channel can also view channel messages, irrespective of the tokens specifically required for reading.

<Admonition type="tip">
  Community Owners can configure view-only channels to allow members to [react](../messaging/react-and-reply-to-messages.mdx) to messages. Check out [Customize your channel](./customize-your-channel.mdx) for more information.

## Using a view-only channel

View-only channels can help keep your community organized and focused. Here are some ideas on how you can use view-only channels.

- **Community announcements and updates** – To keep important announcements or updates clutter-free, use a view-only channel. Only community Owners and admins can write in these channels, ensuring your message is delivered without distractions.

- **Information sharing** – If there are specific resources or guidelines that members need to access regularly, a view-only channel is a convenient and easy-to-find repository. For example, you can share information that new community members may find helpful.

- **Learning communities** – In learning communities, view-only channels allow Owners to share exercises and training materials while keeping the conversation focused.

- **Voting or pooling areas** – Because members with view-only access can still [react to messages](../messaging/react-and-reply-to-messages.mdx) in view-only channels, Owners can use them for voting on different topics or proposals.
