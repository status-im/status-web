A Status Community is a virtual space for like-minded people to exchange ideas and collaborate.

There are different [types of communities](../communities/about-the-different-types-of-status-communities.mdx) in Status, and the requirements to join them differ depending on the type. Some communities are open to everyone, while others require holding a specific token or approval by the community Owner.

## What to expect

- You must [share at least one account address](./join-a-status-community.mdx#about-sharing-your-wallet-account-address) from your Status Wallet when joining a community. You can [change the addresses you share](./choose-the-wallet-account-address-you-share-with-a-community.mdx) at any time.
- The aggregated balance of the shared addresses must meet the token requirements of the community you want to join or the [management role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) you are about to take. For example, if a community requires 100 SNT to join, you must hold at least 100 SNT across all shared addresses.
- After you [request to join](./about-community-request-approvals.mdx) a community, you become a member immediately or you need to wait until the Owner accepts you if the community requires approval.
- For communities requiring join approval, you can view your request status or cancel your pending request on the community page.
- If the community Owner rejects you, you can send a new request to join the community.

<Admonition type="info">
  You receive a notification in the Status app when the community Owner accepts or rejects you.

## About sharing your Wallet account address

When you join a community, you share one or more of your Status Wallet addresses. This action confirms you have the tokens for token-gated communities or channels, lets you participate in airdrops or fulfil a [management role](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) in the community.

No matter which [type of community](./about-the-different-types-of-status-communities.mdx) you want to join, you must share at least one Wallet account address (or address, for short) with the [community's control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx). If you have only one address, it's automatically selected when joining the community and you can't unselect this address.

The addresses you share are stored in the community [control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx) and never revealed to the community Owner or members. However, the community Owner might discover their member addresses indirectly.

<Admonition type="tip">
  Consider creating [dedicated addresses](../wallet/create-wallet-accounts.mdx) for specific communities to protect your security and privacy.

## Join a Status Community

To join token-gated communities, you must hold the required tokens by [buying crypto](../wallet/buy-crypto.mdx) or receiving them from others.

  An airdrop distributes free tokens, including assets (virtual coins), collectibles (NFTs) and ENS names. In Status, only [community Owners and TokenMasters](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx) can airdrop tokens, often to promote or manage their communities.
