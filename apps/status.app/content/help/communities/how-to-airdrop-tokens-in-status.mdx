  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.

  You can only airdrop tokens using the Status desktop app.

The community Owner and TokenMaster roles can airdrop tokens to community and non-community members using the Status app. In airdrops, Owners or TokenMasters distribute free tokens for different purposes, such as to reward the community, incentivize community participation, promote a new token or decentralize the token ownership.

Tokens include assets (virtual coins), collectibles and ENS names. You can airdrop assets and collectibles in Status. These can be [assets you mint](./mint-tokens-for-your-community.mdx) or [import to the community](./import-tokens-to-your-community.mdx).

To airdrop tokens, you can choose between [Ethereum](../getting-started/about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx) or one of the [Layer-2 networks](../wallet/lower-your-fees-with-layer-2-networks.mdx) supported by Status. Your network of choice determines the cost and speed of your airdrop campaign. For more information, check out [Blockchain networks comparison for airdrops](./blockchain-networks-comparison-for-airdrops.mdx).

## What to expect

- Only the community Owner and TokenMaster roles can run airdrops.
- If the asset you want to airdrop exists in multiple networks, you can [choose the network to airdrop](./choose-the-network-for-your-airdrop-campaign.mdx). Collectibles are unique digital items on a specific blockchain network.
- To run a new airdrop campaign, you need to complete a transaction in the blockchain. As with other blockchain transactions, Owners must pay a transaction fee (gas fee). To learn more about this fee, check out [Understand network fees](../wallet/understand-network-fees.mdx).
- The limit of tokens you can airdrop depends on the number of tokens you own, your Wallet account balance to cover the gas fees and the block gas limit for the network where the airdrop takes place.
- You can airdrop tokens in more than one network simultaneously. This process requires paying gas fees on each one of the networks.

  The blockchain you choose charges the airdrop network fee. Status doesn't charge any fee for airdrops.
