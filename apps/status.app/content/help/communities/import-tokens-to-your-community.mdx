title: Import tokens to your community

roles:
- Owner

In Status Communities, Owners and TokenMasters can [mint new tokens](./mint-tokens-for-your-community.mdx) and use them to set [token-based](./token-based-access-to-communities-and-channels.mdx) communities and channels or [delegate permissions](./delegate-management-functions-to-your-community.mdx) to other members.

In addition to minting new tokens, Owners and TokenMasters can import existing ERC-20 tokens to their community. Importing is useful if you want to use one of the tokens in token lists such as [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/)<ExternalIcon /> instead of your own minted token.

<Admonition type="info">
  Token lists are directories of verified crypto tokens that platforms like [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/)<ExternalIcon /> or [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/)<ExternalIcon /> keep. These lists include token names, symbols and contract addresses to help users interact with tokens securely.

## What to expect

- You import a new token to your community when you set up a new community or channel permission.
- The tokens you import appear in your personal settings under the navigation sidebar <ContextTag icon={<SettingsDesktopIcon />}>Settings</ContextTag> > <ContextTag icon={<WalletDesktopIcon />}>Wallet</ContextTag> > <ContextTag>Manage tokens</ContextTag> option.
- Owners and TokenMasters can import assets (virtual currencies, such as USDS or UNI) to their community. Currently, it is not possible to import existing  collectibles (NFTs).

<Admonition type="info">
  Adding your own list of tokens is not supported yet. You can only add tokens to your community by minting them or importing them from the Uniswap or Status token lists.
