<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

In Status, there are different types of communities, and your ability to access them depends on three factors that work independently: token requirements, join requirements and discoverability.

<Admonition type="info">
  Private communities are not visible or discoverable on the communities [Discover page](./how-to-use-status-communities-your-quick-start-guide.mdx#discover-communities). You can only join a private community by [importing an invite link](./import-a-community-someone-shares-with-you.mdx) or receiving an invite from a community member.

## Communities examples

Imagine you're a fan of a digital artist who manages a Status Community. This community is specifically for those who own the artist's issued collectibles (NFTs). In this case, the artist's community could be token-gated using the artist's collectibles, public and with no approval to join. Thus, the artist could build a larger fan base more quickly.

Consider another situation where your organization plans to run a Status Community only for its members. To restrict access to unrelated individuals, your organization could create a token-gated community and require approval for joining. If the organization prefers to stay unnoticed by the public, it could advocate for the community to stay private.
