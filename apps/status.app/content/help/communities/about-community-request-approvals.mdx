<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.

The community Owner might require new members to get manual approval before [joining the community](./join-a-status-community.mdx). When manual approval is set, the Owner, TokenMaster or Admin review each request and decide whether to accept the join request based on their criteria.

<Admonition type="info">
  In addition to manual approval, community Owners can set up [token requirements](./understand-token-requirements-in-communities.mdx) to join their communities. Manual approval and token requirements work independently.

## How to check the status of your request

To check the status of your request, go to the community screen.

If the community Owner approves your request to join, you get access to the community immediately.

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you're a community Owner and want to set up manual approval, read [Set up your community join requests](./set-up-your-community-join-requests.mdx).
