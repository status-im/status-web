<Admonition type="beta" status="Experimental">
  Recovering your Status Community is an experimental feature.
</Admonition>

As a community Owner, you can recover your Status Community if the [control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx) becomes inaccessible due to data corruption, operating system error or hardware problem.

<Admonition type="info">
  If you still have access to the Status desktop installation in the damaged control node, try to [transfer you community's ownership](./transfer-your-community-s-ownership.mdx) first.
</Admonition>

To recover your Status Community, you must meet all these conditions:

- Know the [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx) (your mnemonic phrase) for the community's Owner profile.
- Recover the control node within 30 days of the last time your community connected to the internet.
- Have the [Owner token](./understand-the-owner-and-tokenmaster-tokens.mdx) in your Status Wallet.

If you don't meet all these conditions, you lose control of your Status Community irretrievably. In this scenario, the community remains active with [minimal functionality](./common-issues-when-the-community-s-control-node-is-offline.mdx), but without Owner and control node (orphaned community).

<Admonition type="info">
  Even if your community has a [TokenMaster or Admins](./about-the-management-roles-in-status-communities.mdx), they can't recover the community because there is no control node, and these roles don't have permission to transfer it.
</Admonition>

## Steps to recover your Status Community

<AwaitedList>
  - Using a new computer, install Status desktop using the recovery phrase of the community Owner profile.
  - Verify the [Owner token](./understand-the-owner-and-tokenmaster-tokens.mdx) is in your Status Wallet.
  - [Finalise the control node replacement](./replace-your-community-s-control-node.mdx#step-2-finalise-control-node-replacement) in the new Status desktop installation.
  - After transferring, check that your community is fully functional and connected to the internet.
