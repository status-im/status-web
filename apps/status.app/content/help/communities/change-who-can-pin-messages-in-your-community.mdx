When you create a Status Community, you can [configure additional settings](./create-a-status-community.mdx#configure-additional-settings) for it, such as who can pin messages in community channels.

By default, only the community Owner, TokenMaster and Admin roles can pin messages. However, you can change this setting to allow any community member to pin messages in channels.

## Change who can pin messages in your community
