<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

If you can't manage your Status Community anymore, you can transfer the ownership to someone else. To transfer your community ownership, you must [send the Owner token](#step-1-send-the-owner-token) to the new Owner.

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you need help managing your community, consider adding others as Admins or TokenMasters. For more information, check out [Delegate management functions to community members](./delegate-management-functions-to-your-community.mdx).
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- Transferring your community's ownership is an irreversible action. Once you do so, you can't undo it and you lose your community Owner status.
- You can transfer your community ownership to members or non-members. If you transfer ownership to a non-member, they join the community automatically upon accepting the ownership transfer.
- The new Owner can accept or reject the ownership transfer. If the new Owner accepts the transfer, they must complete a transaction and pay the [gas fees](../wallet/understand-network-fees.mdx).
- When the new Owner accepts the ownership transfer, their computer automatically becomes the new [control node](./about-the-control-node-in-status-communities.mdx) for the community.

<Admonition type="info">
  The computer acting as the control node must be online, with the Status desktop app running as frequently as possible. If the control node is offline, the community [loses some functionalities](./common-issues-when-the-community-s-control-node-is-offline.mdx).

## Transfer your community's ownership

### Step 1: Send the Owner token

The current Owner must complete this step.

### Step 2: Finalize the ownership transfer

The new Owner must complete this step by submitting a transaction to update the community's smart contract and finalizing the ownership transfer.

    1. On the <ContextTag>Finalize \[community name] ownership</ContextTag> screen, review the information about the ownership transfer. The account where you receive the Owner token must have enough funds to pay the transaction fees. If you don't have enough funds, close the screen and top up your account.
    1. Check the <ContextTag>I acknowledge that \[...]</ContextTag> checkbox and click <ContextTag>Make this device the control node and update smart contract</ContextTag>.
    1. Wait for the transaction to complete. Once the transaction is confirmed, you can see a notification confirming that your computer is the new control node.
