<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.
</Admonition>

In Status, the only way to join a [group chat](./understand-group-chats.mdx) is to ask your contact who's already a member to invite you. Refer them to [Add members to a group chat](./add-members-to-a-group-chat.mdx) for instructions on how they can do that.
