You may think about closing your chat with someone if you don't talk to this person often, or you want to tidy up your chat list.

### What to expect

- You can close a direct message chat (or DM, for short) with someone in your chat list, but you can't close a group chat.
- Closing a chat doesn't delete the messages or your contact.
- If this person sends you a new message, the chat reappears on your chat list.
