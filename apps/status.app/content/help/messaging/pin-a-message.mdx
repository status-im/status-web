You can pin important information in chats so that it doesn't get lost in the message history. For example, you can pin your chat rules, event announcements or FAQ.

## The basics

- You can pin messages in DMs, group chats and community channels.
- Group chat members can pin both their own and other members' messages.
- Once you pin a message, it's highlighted and gets a label saying who pinned it.
- In communities, whether you can pin someone's message depends on [your role](../communities/permissions-by-role-in-status-communities.mdx#permissions-for-key-features) and the [settings](../communities/create-a-status-community.mdx#configure-additional-settings) chosen by the community owner.
