<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.
</Admonition>

Any member of a group chat can add their [Status contacts](../messaging/add-a-contact-in-status.mdx) to the chat. A group chat can have 20 members at most, including the creator. Because of Status' privacy-focused design, new joiners can't see the previous message history.

If you want to create a new chat, see [Create a group chat](./create-a-group-chat.mdx) instead.
