<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.

Group chats are conversations of more than two people. To invite someone to a group chat, you need to [have them on your Status contact list](./add-a-contact-in-status.mdx).

Group chats aren't the same as communities: they're meant for smaller groups of people. To learn more about group chats, check out [Understand group chats](./understand-group-chats.mdx).

## What to expect

- A group chat can have 20 members at most, including the creator. If you need to include more people, [create a community](../communities/create-a-status-community.mdx) instead.
- Once you create your group chat, you can [customize it](./customize-a-group-chat.mdx) and [add members](./add-members-to-a-group-chat.mdx), as well as [remove them](./remove-members-from-a-group-chat.mdx).
- Group chats are always end-to-end [encrypted](./about-status-messages.mdx#built-in-privacy-and-security) with secure cryptographic keys. Only the group chat members have access to the messages in it.

<Admonition type="info">
  Status doesn't have your group chat keys and can't access any messages by design.
