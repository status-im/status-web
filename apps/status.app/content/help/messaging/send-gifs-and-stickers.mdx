<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in beta. This means the app is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable in the app.

Animated GIFs and stickers are a popular way of expressing emotions, reactions and humour in messaging apps. GIFs are short, looping animated videos of a few seconds in length, while stickers are static or animated images.

The Status app uses the [Tenor GIF](https://tenor.com/)<ExternalIcon /> search engine and database for GIFs. You can also share GIFs from other sources by sending a message with your GIF's URL.

You can add more stickers to default sticker sets in Status or share a sticker set with someone. For more details, check out [Add, remove or share sticker sets](./add-remove-or-share-sticker-sets.mdx).

<Admonition type="info">
  To show the GIF preview and not its URL, [enable rich link previews](../profile/configure-rich-link-previews-in-messages.mdx) in messages.
