There are two ways to find people in Status.

If you are in the same group chat or [Status Community](../communities/how-to-use-status-communities-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) with the user, you can open the group chat or community and view the member list. From there, you can select their name and then select <ContextTag icon={<ProfileIcon />}>Send contact request</ContextTag>.

Alternatively, ask the user to [share their profile link or the QR code](../profile/share-your-status-profile.mdx) and use the information to [add them to your contacts](../messaging/add-a-contact-in-status.mdx).
