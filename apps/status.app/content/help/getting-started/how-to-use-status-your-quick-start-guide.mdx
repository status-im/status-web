  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.

[Status](./what-is-status.mdx) is an open-source, decentralized crypto communication app. You can install Status on your computer and mobile devices.

With Status, you can complete various [activities](./understand-your-actions-in-status.mdx) such as managing crypto assets, exploring dApps, messaging your contacts and interacting with people in Status Communities.

<Admonition type="info">
  In Status version 2.0 and higher, the web3 browser has been deprecated in favour of WalletConnect. You can [access dApps using WalletConnect](../wallet/connect-to-dapps-using-walletconnect.mdx) in Status.

## Your first steps

If you [run Status for the first time](./run-the-status-app-for-the-first-time.mdx), you start with [creating a profile](./create-a-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase.mdx).

There's no need for any personally identifiable information (like your email or phone number) to create a Status profile. Instead, the Status app generates a public and a private [cryptographic keys](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx) (a key pair) for authentication and authorization.

Your private key is associated with a [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx#about-your-recovery-phrase). If you lose or damage your device, you can restore access to your Status data and wallet funds using your recovery phrase on a new device. To secure your profile, [back up and secure your recovery phrase](../profile/back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx) as soon as you can.

If you prefer using multiple identities, [create additional Status profiles](../profile/create-and-use-additional-status-profiles.mdx). Beyond that, customize your wallet accounts with emojis, and give your [group chats](../messaging/customize-a-group-chat.mdx) and [communities](../communities/customize-your-community.mdx) their unique look with images and colours.

## Explore web3 securely

Any Status user can see your profile including your profile picture, it's crucial to safeguard your personal details. Consider [customizing your profile to reveal less information](../profile/view-and-edit-your-status-profile.mdx) to those you don't know well.

You can quickly learn your relationship with a Status user by [labelling their profile](../profile/understand-status-profile-labels.mdx). If someone makes you feel uncomfortable, you can [block the user](../profile/block-or-unblock-someone-in-status.mdx) or [mark the user as untrusted](../profile/verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx). To make sure your contact is genuine, you can [verify the user's identity](../profile/verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx) or [mark the user as identity verified](../profile/verify-your-contacts-identity.mdx).

Status Wallet is a self-custodial wallet where you have complete control over your cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. This means that you're fully responsible for [the security of your assets](../profile/secure-your-information-and-funds.mdx), including the private key protecting them. Always [keep your credentials safe](../profile/back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx) and protect yourself from [scams](../wallet/understand-common-scams.mdx).

At the same time, you can choose to use Status with [Keycard](../keycard/keycard-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) to store private keys offline in an air-gapped environment.
