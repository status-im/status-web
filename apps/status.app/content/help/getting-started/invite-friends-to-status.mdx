<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

If some of your friends don't have Status profiles yet, you can invite them and help them find you in the app. Once they [download](https://status.app) and install Status, [share your profile with them](../profile/share-your-status-profile.mdx) and ask them to [add you to their contacts](../messaging/add-a-contact-in-status.mdx).
