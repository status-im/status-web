title: Create a Status profile using a recovery phrase
author: jorge-campo

<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

You can use your existing Ethereum address to create a new Status profile. For instance, if you already have a [non-custodial Ethereum wallet](../wallet/status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet, you already have an Ethereum address and a [recovery phrase](../profile/understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase.mdx).

<Admonition type="tip">
  If you want to use your Status profile on multiple devices, [sync your device](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx) for the best experience.
</Admonition>

## What to expect

- Your wallet funds are safe and recoverable as long as you know your recovery phrase and [keep it safe](../profile/back-up-and-secure-your-recovery-phrase.mdx).
- When you create a profile using an existing Ethereum address that already has funds, you can operate with your funds using [Status Wallet](../wallet/how-to-use-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.mdx).
- If you already have a Status profile created with the same recovery phrase, and you have used it within the past 30 days, you can choose to recover it or continue with the new profile.
- If you haven't used Status in the past 30 days, your profile is unrecoverable on new devices. You have to sign in from the device you used the profile to recover it. Your funds are safe if you know the recovery phrase.

</Tabs>

If Status finds an existing profile in the [Waku network](../messaging/about-status-messages.mdx#understand-peer-to-peer-messaging), you can use your existing profile or the one you have just created. When you choose your existing profile, [sync this profile](../profile/sync-your-profile-across-devices.mdx) with your other device if you have one.

<Admonition type="caution">
  Status doesn't know your password and can't reset it for you. If you forget your password and don't have your recovery phrase, you lose access to your Status profile and Wallet accounts. <br /> Remember your Status password, keep it in a safe place and don't share it with anyone.
</Admonition>

## Customize your profile

Here you only fill out basic information. You can [customize your Status profile further](../profile/view-and-edit-your-status-profile.mdx) at any time in the Status settings.
