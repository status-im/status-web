<Admonition type="beta" status="Status app is currently in beta stage">
  The Status app is currently in its beta stage. This means the application is still undergoing active development, and certain features described in this document may function differently or be unavailable within the app.
</Admonition>

The Status app is a secure wallet and communication tool, combining  [crypto wallet](../wallet/status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.mdx), [messaging](../messaging/about-status-messages.mdx) and [communities](../communities/how-to-use-status-communities-your-quick-start-guide.mdx). Status protects your privacy and rights while also promoting your sovereignty and freedom of expression.

Status is an open-source project providing the Status app software for free. You can download the app and build your community without needing permission from us or anyone else.

<Admonition type="info">
  Status doesn't provide any services, and you don't need to pay or subscribe to use the Status app.

## Privacy and decentralization at the core of Status

At Status, privacy is the principle that shapes our design and technology. You don't need to share your personal details, such as your phone number, email address or credit card information, to use Status.

We've designed the Status app to keep your personal information inaccessible to us because what you do on our app is not our business. Only you and the people you're talking to can read your conversations, and nobody, including Status, can censor your content or restrict your access to the app.

Status firmly believes in decentralization and permissionlessness. You have complete control over your personal information, and no central authority can control it.

  The SNT token is part of our greater aspirations and political aims. For more information, check out [About the Status SNT token](../wallet/about-the-status-snt-token.mdx).
</Admonition>

## Status Communities: your self-sovereign space

Status Communities are self-sovereign spaces where users are in control. Members autonomously control each community, set its rules and bear responsibility for its actions.

Communities are decentralized and powered by members using the Status desktop app. Anyone can [create their own Status Community](../communities/create-a-status-community.mdx) for free, and you don't need to pay to run one. Your community is entirely under your control. No one, not even Status, can shut it down, block access or interfere with its operation.

<Admonition type="info">
  While Status doesn't charge you fees for running a community, you may incur costs related to computer or server provision and internet bandwidth.
</Admonition>

You can [customize the look](../communities/create-a-status-community.mdx#customize-your-community) of your community, promote the community to be [public or private](../communities/about-voting-to-change-the-community-visibility.mdx), or make it [token-gated](../communities/set-up-a-token-gated-community.mdx) using ERC-20 assets, collectibles (NFTs) and ENS names.

## Status Messaging: your private communication channel

Status messaging protects your direct messages and group chats using strong end-to-end encryption (E2EE). The Status app also offers [unique privacy aspects](../messaging/messages-faq.mdx) like metadata privacy, perfect forward secrecy (PFS), decentralization and permissionlessness.

<Admonition type="tip">
  [PFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_secrecy)<ExternalIcon /> is a security feature that prevents past messages from being decrypted even if your private key is compromised.
</Admonition>

Status messaging is fully decentralized and powered by [Waku](https://waku.org/)<ExternalIcon />, a peer-to-peer protocol for private, secure and censorship-resistant communication. We ensure that your conversations and the information about who you're talking to remain confidential and only available to people in the chat.

<Admonition type="info">
  Your Status profile and messages are temporarily saved in the [Waku](https://waku.org)<ExternalIcon /> peer-to-peer network and stored permanently on your device. They are not saved on the blockchain or transmitted via the Ethereum network.
</Admonition>

## Status Wallet: your secure crypto vault

[Status Wallet](../wallet/status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.mdx) is a self-custodial wallet for your crypto, including Ethereum-based assets and collectibles. You have complete control over your crypto, and no one can freeze or lock your tokens.

In addition to [Ethereum](./about-the-ethereum-blockchain.mdx), Status Wallet supports other [Layer-2 blockchain networks](../wallet/lower-your-fees-with-layer-2-networks.mdx) fully committed to decentralization, such as Optimism and Arbitrum.

You can send and receive crypto across different networks using a simple interface. Status Wallet calculates the most cost-effective way to move tokens from one place to another, considering gas prices and bridge costs (transfer costs).

## Status + dApps: your gateway to the decentralized web

In Status version 2.0 and higher, the web3 browser has been deprecated. Instead, the Status app securely connects to web3 dApps using [WalletConnect](https://www.walletconnect.com/)<ExternalIcon /> through its integrated crypto wallet.

WalletConnect connects your Wallet to [decentralized applications](../wallet/about-decentralized-apps-in-status-wallet.mdx) (or dApps for short) directly from the Status app, using a QR code or link. With this setup, you can use your favourite web browser and enjoy a familiar experience while using dApps.
