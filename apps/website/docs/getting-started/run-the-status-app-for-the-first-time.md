title: Run the Status app for the first time
---

When you run Status for the first time, the app creates a pair of [cryptographic keys] [understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase] representing your Status identity. Unlike centralized apps, Status doesn't rely on your username or email address to identify your profile. Instead, it uses your private and public keys.

These keys are securely stored on your device and protected by your Status password. To understand how these keys work and how they protect your data and privacy, check out [Understand your Status keys and recovery phrase][understand-your-status-keys-and-recovery-phrase].

## Create a new Status profile

If you want to create your profile from an existing recovery phrase, check out [Create or restore your Status profile using a recovery phrase][create-or-restore-your-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase]. If you're going to use a Keycard to create your profile, check out [Create or restore your Status profile using Keycard][create-or-restore-your-status-profile-using-keycard].
