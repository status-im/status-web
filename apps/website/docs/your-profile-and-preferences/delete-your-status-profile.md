title: Delete your Status profile
---

Status uses a [peer-to-peer network][peer-to-peer-messaging] that temporarily stores your profile information and data. Because of this decentralized network, there is no one-click way to delete your profile and all associated data.

## What to expect

- If you decide to stop using a profile, you can leave it inactive for 30 days or more. By doing so, the Status peer-to-peer network stops caching your information and the profile is irretrievably lost. You can always create a new Status profile.
- Though your profile is lost, your wallet funds are not. Your wallet funds are safe and available if you know [your recovery phrase] [create-or-restore-your-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase].
- The messages you sent are still accessible to the recipients, whether they are direct messages or messages in a group chat or community.
- People still can see all information you display on your profile screen. For example, your profile name, photo, bio and linked social media.
