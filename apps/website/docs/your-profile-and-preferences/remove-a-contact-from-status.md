title: Remove a contact from Status
---

You can remove any contact from your Status contact list. In Status, you need to add people as contacts to start a conversation. After you remove a Status contact, neither you nor your contact can send new messages to each other.

## What to expect

- Removing a contact from Status removes the identity verification associated with that contact but not their reputation (trusted or untrusted).
- After you remove a contact, your direct messages with them remain. To delete these messages, [delete the chat][delete-a-chat-with-someone].
- A user not on your contact list can still see your profile and send you a contact request. To prevent this, you can [block the user][block-someone-in-status].

:::info
Status doesn't access or use your phone's contact list. When you remove a contact from Status who is also on your phone's contact list, that person stays on your list.
