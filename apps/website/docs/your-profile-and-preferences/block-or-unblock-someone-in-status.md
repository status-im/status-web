title: Block or unblock someone in Status
---

You can block a stranger or an existing contact to stop receiving harmful content and excluding the user entirely from your experience with Status.

:::warn
Blocking someone deletes all messages from the user. Status can't recover them for you.
:::

## What to expect

- Blocked users don't receive any notifications or see any changes. They only know that you have stopped messaging them.
- You can't see any messages sent by blocked users, including direct messages and messages in mutual group chats, channels and communities.
- A blocked user can see your previous direct messages and future messages you send in mutual group chats, channels and communities.
- Status permanently deletes all messages sent by the blocked user, including direct messages and messages in mutual group chats, channels and communities.
- Unblocking a user does not restore deleted messages.
- Status stops showing blocked users as mutual contacts.
