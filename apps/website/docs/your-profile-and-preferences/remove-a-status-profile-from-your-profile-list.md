title: Remove a Status profile from your profile list
---

If you don't want a profile to show up on your device, you can remove it.

:::info
A profile removed from your device is not deleted. Check out [Delete your Status profile](./delete-your-status-profile.md).
:::

## What to expect

- When you remove a profile from one device, the associated data is deleted from that device. To delete the data from all devices, repeat the procedure on all devices where you use the profile.
- If you don't log into your Status profile for 30 days or more (on any device), your crypto funds are safe, but your profile is [irrecoverably lost](./delete-your-status-profile.md). You can always create another Status profile [using your recovery phrase](../getting-started/create-or-restore-your-status-profile-using-a-recovery-phrase.md)
