title: Respond to a contact request
---

Status users who search for your profile or you interact with can send you contact requests. For example, users you have shared your profile with or those in mutual communities or group chats with you.

:::tip
If you want to send a contact request, check out [Add a contact in Status](./add-a-contact-in-status.md).
:::

## What to expect

- Contact requests expire after seven days.
- Status users can send you a new request every seven days. If it bothers you, consider [blocking the user](./block-or-unblock-someone-in-status#block-stranger.md).
- People you have [blocked](./block-or-unblock-someone-in-status.md) can't see your profile or send you a contact request.
- Rejecting a request does not notify the sender.
- You can [turn off contact requests](./respond-to-a-contact-request#stop-contact-requests.md) to stop receiving any new requests.
