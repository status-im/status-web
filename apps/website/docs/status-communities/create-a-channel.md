title: Create a channel
---

:::info
Currently, you can only create a channel using Status desktop.
:::

Community owners can create public and private channels in the Status app. All community members can browse and join public channels. To join private channels, members must meet the [channel requirements][understand-token-requirements-in-channels]. As a community owner, you can set up specific permissions to create a private channel.

## Create a channel

=== "Desktop"

    1. From the navigation sidebar, click the community where you want to create a channel.
    1. In the **Community** sidebar, right-click the empty space and select **Create Channel**.
    1. Type your **Channel name**. Optionally, click :desktop-emojis: **Emoji** to choose an emoji.
    1. Optionally, choose a **Channel colour** and add a **Description** of your channel.
    1. Click **Create Channel**.

If you need to set up additional permissions, click **Add permissions** and check out [configure channel permissions][configure-channel-permissions]. For example, you can create a view-only announcement channel or a channel all members can view and post in.
