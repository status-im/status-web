title: 'Channels: your quick start guide'
---

In [Status Communities][how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide], you have access to dedicated spaces called channels. Channels bring the right people and information together for any project or topic. A channel conversation focuses on specific topics, and you can [join](./join-a-channel.md) and [leave](./leave-a-channel.md) the conversation anytime.

As a community owner, you can use channels to break down a large community into smaller, more focused sub-groups. With Status, you can [configure channel permissions][configure-channel-permissions] based on token ownership. For example, you can make a public channel private or view-only by only allowing holders of specific tokens to join or post.

To add channels to your community, check out [Create a channel][create-a-channel].

=== ":mobile-one: Channel information"
You can see the channel name and permissions here. Private channels have a :mobile-locked-lock: lock icon. From this area, you can select :mobile-more-options: **More options** to view more details about the channel, such as channel members, permissions or notifications.

=== ":mobile-two: Pinned message area"
Channel members can [pin messages][pin-a-message] to this area, such as announcements, FAQ or channel rules.

This area shows the channel activity, including messages, photos, reactions or links.

From here, you can send messages to channel members with [text][send-and-read-messages], [images][share-images-in-status] or emojis, as well as [audio messages][send-an-audio-message].

## The #general channel

The #general channel is created by default when you [create a community][create-a-status-community]. You can use this channel for various purposes, including sharing news, discussing community policies and events or making announcements.

This channel works like any other channel. As a community administrator, here's how you can make this channel more helpful:

- Don't rename the channel. The #general channel is widely recognized and understood in communities. Renaming the channel may confuse members.
- [Set up permissions][configure-channel-permissions] to restrict who can post in #general. This removes noise from the channel and keeps it on topic.
- Use the #general channel to [pin messages][pin-a-message] describing FAQs, community rules or other information relevant to your community.
