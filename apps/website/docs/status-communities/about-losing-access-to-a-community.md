title: About losing access to a community
---

You can lose your Status Community membership for different reasons. For example, a [token-gated community][about-status-communities] can change the token requirements to join, or your behaviour breaks the community rules.

The community owner can permanently ban your account if you break the community rules. Respect the community rules and members, and don't spam people or promote scams or deceptive practices.

## The basics

- If you lose access to a community, you must request to [join the community][join-a-status-community] again.
- For token-gated communities, you should hold the token requirements at all times.
- When you lose access to a community, it does show up under the Joined tab on your [Communities page][how-to-use-communities-your-quick-start-guide].
- In the [notifications centre][view-notifications-and-updates], your Membership notifications show when you have lost access to a community. You don't receive a notification when you're banned from a community.

Community owners control who has access to their communities. Status can't kick you out or ban you from a community. Likewise, Status can't grant you access to a community or override the community owner's actions.
