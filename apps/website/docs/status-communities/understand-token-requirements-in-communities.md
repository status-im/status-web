title: Understand token requirements in communities
---

In Status, there are two kinds of communities: public and private. If you want to [join a private community](./join-a-status-community.md), you need to meet the token requirements set by the community owner. To maintain access to a private community, hold the necessary tokens at all times.

For example, a community owner can set up owning 10 SNT as a requirement to join their community. In that case, you need a minimum of 10 SNT in your [Status Wallet](../status-wallet/status-wallet-your-quick-start-guide.md) to join that community.

There are three kinds of tokens in the Status app: assets, collectibles and ENS (Ethereum Name Service) names. Community owners can set up any combination of these tokens as a requirement to join their communities.

:::info
When you join a private community, the token or tokens required to join are not transferred to anyone. They are used for verification purposes only, and they remain in your possession and wallet.

## If you meet the requirements

Before you join a private community, the Status app automatically checks if you meet the community requirements. If you meet the requirements, the option to join the community is available.

:::info
If the community owner has set [manual approval](./manage-community-join-requests.md) option for their community, you still need the owner's approval to join.

## If you don't meet the token requirements

If the request button is greyed out and unavailable, it means that you don't meet the token requirements to join a community in the Status app. To apply to join the community, you need to have the required amount of tokens. To buy the required tokens, read [Buy crypto](../status-wallet/buy-crypto.md).
