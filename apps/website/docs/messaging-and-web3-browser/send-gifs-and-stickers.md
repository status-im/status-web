title: Send GIFs and stickers
---

Animated GIFs and stickers are a popular way of expressing emotions, reactions and humour in messaging apps. GIFs are short, looping animated videos of a few seconds in length, while stickers are static or animated images.

The Status app uses the [Tenor GIF :octicons-tab-external-16:](https://tenor.com/) search engine and database for GIFs. You can also share GIFs from other sources by sending a message with the GIF URL.

You can add more stickers to default sticker sets in Status, or share a sticker set with someone. See [Add, remove or share sticker sets](./add-remove-or-share-sticker-sets.md).

To show the GIF preview and not its URL, [enable rich link previews](../your-profile-and-preferences/enable-rich-link-previews-in-messages.md) in messages.
