- reuse existing UI components and Tailwind configuration from `packages/components/`
- reuse colors from `packages/colors/`
- reuse icons from `packages/icons/`
- search for components in `apps/` and extract or create new ones by orchestrating ui components if you can't find any existing that solves the problem
- ask the human how they want to proceed when there are missing components and designs
